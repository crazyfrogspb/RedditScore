"So the years of obstructionism and foot stomping by the republicans over Obamacare... the constant complaints of it being so awful and trying to get it repealed 50+ times... the constant attacks on Obama because of it... and no one in the party thought to come up with a plan? It's been over half a decade and they never thought of what they'd do if they actually ever got it repealed?This is precisely my issue with the republican party. They only seem to want to change things just because it wasn't their idea but they never actually have any ideas of their own. Everything is terrible and they'll vote against anything from the left but when it comes time to put up they have literally no plan. The party appears to be purely reactionary and obstructive.

"I'm not saying that there are no benefits to leftish neoliberalism.  I am simply claiming that it has underperformed.  As far as the Democrats go, a Left-wing party would not seek merely to respond to popular sentiment; rather it would seek to create Left-wing popular sentiment.  By contrast, the Democrats specialize in short-sighted opportunism, and that is what has produced the current state of affairs.  Racism is real, but it is hardly a new feature of American politics, and in the past it was possible to build consensus for social democractic policies.  The answer as to why that consensus broke down has to go beyond the mere fact of racism.  Concerning organized labor, I would say that the US labor movement also has many internal problems which have led to declining labor representation (maffia influence one of the big ones), but the desire for workplace democracy is fairly universal so there is no good reason why a labor movement doesn't thrive in a democractic society.",prinzplagueorange,1501449217,t3_6qgte0,t1_dkxqd49,13,0,dkxtftd,PoliticalDiscussion,183,0.07103825136612021

"I promise I can give you all that in one book however it'll require genuine effort but those rewards you are looking for were never going to come cheap were they?OK, I don't know about making you cry but if you are **serious** about the other requirements then 2,500 years of recorded human experience tells us that you need to consider philosophy. I prefer the analytical variant not the wishy-washy-anything-goes type of philosophy (maybe because I'm a product of an anglo-saxon culture and education system).  I think the best book for the serious student is *Philosophy 1, A Guide Through The Subject* edited by A.C. Grayling. Check out the comments on Amazon. This book was written in the early 1990s for students at the University of London which seemed to have a top notch philosophy degree at the time. I cannot recommend this book highly enough especially for automaths. I should say that the paperback is actually quite sturdy and would probably survive some abuse. It is also as cheap as chips.

"The amount of debt the Fed has bought through QE and other similar programs is only $2.5 Trillion, so even without that money printing we'd still have the real problem which is of course SOCIALISM. Unfortunately in contrast to the QE money printing, the other $17.5 Trillion of US Sovereign debt is all derived from REAL wealth that's been loaned to the U.S. government. That's REAL wealth that's been loaned to the government which people expect to get paid back when their bonds expire. Pension holders, foreign countries, banks, hedge funds, individual investors, etc.So here's how this is going to down. Over the next 4 years we will begin to see massive political pressure to raise interest rates in order to keep pension funds like CalPERS solvent, but the Federal Government will be extremely reluctant to do so because they KNOW they can't afford the interest payments on the debt. So people are going to be hung out to dry, and the bid for U.S. debt is going to start drying up as potential investors lose faith in the Federal Government. **That's when the world is going to question whether they should be loaning money to the U.S. government. The music is going to stop, one way or another.**  The only solution establishment economists will have to this disaster will be to print money and raise taxes at effective rates we've never even come close to seeing before. But of course that's not a real solution, that's just desperation, and it will only delay the inevitable while simultaneously damning the country into an economic depression worse than the 1930s. In all honesty, it could even lead to civil war.The ONLY people who can salvage this situation are Austrian economists and other classical liberals, no one else would even have a clue where to start. For these reasons and more I honestly believe that what happens over the next 10 years will decide the fate of the United States for the next 300 years. The U.S. economy is literally at risk of caving in on itself. [The only real solution is to renegotiate the U.S. debt.](https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/qa/the-solution-the-only-solution/). But even if you successfully renegotiate the U.S. debt, the damage to the fiscal reputation of the US government will be done and no new debt will be bought for decades. With no ability to issue new debt, all the social programs will begin to fall apart. The political opportunities in this period will be tremendous for libertarians and their enemies alike.",LateralusYellow,1486592302,t3_5ssah8,t3_5ssah8,2,0,ddi85ub,Libertarian,34,0.05882352941176471

"Unless you're saying that the United States not abide by rulings from the WTO and ITC, then you can't simply place tariffs on all foreign goods from a given industry.  Even if you could, it wouldn't make political or economic sense. Countries would retaliate and everyone would suffer - these are the very reasons organizations like the WTO and agreements like NAFTA were created I'm the first place. There are many studies showing that the consequences typically outweigh the positives from economic protectionism.  The $1 billion in lost purchasing power that you referenced was from a study that estimated the jobs saved only provided $42 million to the economy: a net loss of $938 million dollars. This was just from tariffs placed on one countries goods - and prices did indeed rise from domestic manufacturers. Of course the upper limit will be the price of the newly tariffed imported good, but those tariffs can be quite high. The ITC recommended a 55% tariff on Chinese tires after the USA's complaint in 2009, and having nearly any good suddenly rise by 55 percent, or 30, or 20, or 15 is what I would consider ""sky rocketing"". There are legitimate reasons why economics books generally describe tariffs as damaging to economies. They promote inefficiencies, isolate companies from competition, and are incredibly expensive to implement. While it's true that you can help to protect jobs - and that it might be necessary in cases where state intervention is distorting the free market - you have to at least acknowledge the very real negative consequences that also come along with such actions and balance them accordingly. Economic protectionism is contrary to capitalist ideals, and it's shocking to see how many conservatives who always speak so highly about the free market are suddenly clamoring for a state intervention that is decidedly anti free market.  Furthermore, many other countries are able to produce cheaper goods without participating in any kind of market distortion - it's just less expensive to produce a good in those countries for whatever reasons (usually labor and regulatory). You can't simply place a tariff on a country because their people will work for less for certain tasks. Instead of a tariff, it might be more efficient to levy a tax (which is what a tariff is anyways) for the re-education/retraining or education for children of affected workers in order to pursue fields that the United States has a comparative advantage in. There are so many better ways -at least from what my economics classes and the studies I've read - to help create jobs than the use of tariffs.  I obviously don't know your background at all, but if you're interested I really suggest checking out this study from the Peterson Institute of Economics. Even some of my smartest and most educated friends weren't required to take an econ class and as such aren't able to create a full picture to base their opinions off of.  It could be that you are an econ professor at Harvard and simply have found or produced research that leads you to suggest that tariffs are a good option, in which case I woukd love to be pointed to it. Otherwise, I think it's important to see that while we can create some jobs through tariffs, it will be at the cost of economic growth.HTTPS://piie.com/publications/pb/pb12-9.pdf",justskot,1479832179,t3_5dmj64,t1_da9rrky,1,0,dab4cm3,conservatives,16,0.0625

"It's an indirect result of the CRTC allowing the cable companies and broadcasters to sign exclusive deals for the country. It's also why you can get blacked-out from a game even though you've paid your provider a completely stupid amount of money for a ""Sports"" package. Certain things should not be allowed as exclusives to one broadcaster/provider vs another for the whole country regardless of the delivery method.If Global, as an example, wants exclusive rights to a show, it should only be for the delivery method they offer (IE Cable/SAT), not all forms of content delivery, blocking companies like Netflix and Hulu from delivering this content to Canadians. You cannot watch a complete season, or past seasons of a show on Global's website without having a Cable subscription from one of the major providers.Hulu's system in the US is almost perfect.  While the networks may have an exclusive to a show for the first airing, Hulu can re-broadcast over the internet 24 hours after it airs. Sure, you might have to change Survivor night from Wednesdays to Thursdays, but at least then you can watch on your time. You can also choose to watch for free with Ads and some restricted content, or you can pay Hulu &lt;$20 /month for a Plus pass and watch everything Ad-Free.TL:DR - Sure, it's not entirely the CRTC's fault, but they are indirectly responsible for allowing the monopolies to continue in many aspects, and the reason companies like Hulu and Netflix cannot provide the same level of service that is available to our neighbours to the south.Edit - Also, the reason why Shomi fell flat on its face was it was a bug-riddled mess, and didn't have nearly enough content to support the price they were charging. Half the time streams wouldn't load, and it had a really bad habbit of cutting off the last minute of a show.  The quality was also sub-par compared to Netflix/Hulu/Crave.Crave's (who's owned by Bell) only saving grace is the HBO exclusive, and even then it's only past content (Year old+).

"The best argument I feel I've heard (and the only one I know for a fact to have changed someone's views on this issue) is more or less as follows.If a man died right now, if he didn't consent to it when he was alive, the government couldn't do anything with his body. They couldn't make use of his body and its organs for any purpose, not research, not even saving the lives of people who need organ donations. He's dead, and he doesn't need any part of his body anymore, and if others could use it, it would *absolutely* save lives, but we as a society view that as abhorrent that he could be forced to donate his body without his consent. In a society that outlaws abortion, that corpse has more rights than a pregnant woman has. The moment she becomes pregnant, her body is now no longer her own to do with as she chooses, she is *forced* to use her body to serve as an incubator.Now,if you're a pro-lifer, I totally understand that you feel that that fetus is, right now at this moment, a person. Not everyone feels the same as you do. Some people, for example, feel that a person becomes a person when they have detectable brain waves, which happens many weeks into a pregnancy. Now, you can disagree with that, but what you can't disagree with is that some child somewhere dying and needing an organ donation absolutely *is* a person.So, if we're to be consistent, we should force everyone to give up the rights to their bodies when they die. Real lives can be saved, both through donation and research, and if we truly are ""pro-life"", we would absolutely want to prioritize the lives of people that *everyone* agrees are people at the expense of those who have already finished their own lives.Or, conversely, if we believe that those corpses are somehow sacred and not to be forced into service against their former owners' will, even to save a life, can't we say the same for a living, breathing woman who doesn't want her body, that she's *still using*, forced into service for a fetus that not everyone can even agree is a person?",CaspianX2,1492032815,t3_64zsvp,t3_64zsvp,7,0,dg6lnyk,PoliticalDiscussion,969,0.007223942208462331

"Its not a strawman to say what he said was ridiculous. He is missing a very crucial detail in his understanding of what compels people to make a product. If it were possible that the amount of time you spent on a project yields a proportional quality then I would agree with bernie. This is not the reality however. Different people have different talents, dreams, likes and dislikes which culminate into what drives that person to do with their life. Which means the reason why there are so many different options for deodorant is not solely because of the profit motive. The secondary motive is a desire to make a product that you know how to make or want to make. These companies would not be in business if there was not enough room in the market. It is true that some are indistinguishable in function and performance, no doubt, but they all are comprised of different materials which to some is enough to write them off because they have adverse reactions to their skin so that element of choice is there not only to motivate people to make different deodorants, but to give the consumer the choice in deciding which one is worth their money. Bernie has yet to say what his solution to this situation even is. How can you be a man of the people but talk about limiting the choices we have in the market? Would this not lead to conglomerates having a crony stranglehold on one of bernie's theoretical market brand choice limits?So what is he even advocating for here? Government™ deodorant?

"So, a lot of the advice you've gotten here from people who strippers generally view as a nightmare to deal with; a lot of the information they're giving you is what we consider to be in rude, over the line, or flat out gross. You may want to take what they said with a grain of salt because though they may be well intentioned, you won't be well liked by the strippers if you take their advice, especially the bit about leggings and sweatpants. Jeans and a cute top is fine for you, slacks or jeans for him. PLEEEEAAAASE DO NOT WEAR SWEATPANTS! I can't stress it enough. When I'm dancing on a guy I don't want to feel every detail of his dick. Yes, I understand that boners come with the territory; it's a natural body reaction, fine. But there is a difference between me feeling your boner through regular pants, and me feeling every last curve and detail of your dick wedging itself between my legs when I sit on your lap. There's a difference between a barely noticeable bulge hidden by proper pants, and me turning around to find see some dude grinning stupidly, legs spread with a blatant tent in their lap. I and most strippers I know avoid men who come in wearing sweats because it is very apparent what they're after. These are the guys who will push our boundaries; you tell them what the rules are and they will repeatedly try to break them and violate our boundaries. These are the guys who I spend the whole dance time trying to avoid their fingers being shoved up my pussy because they don't know what ""no"" means or flat out don't care. If I do agree to dance for you and you're in sweats, I won't be giving you as much contact as I otherwise would; I won't grind on your lap, and you will basically get an air dance.IF you even get in. Most clubs have dress codes and sweat pants will probably get you turned away at the door. This is why some of the guys in here are suggesting leggings that look like actual pants, because they KNOW sweats aren't acceptable, and they KNOW why clubs ban them, but think their dick feels are more important. Please don't listen to them. There is no faster way to let every stripper in the room know what a creep you are than to walk in wearing sweatpants or athletic shorts. I'm gonna put up another response answering your other questions too, OP, but I saw people in the comments suggesting that to you and just had to say something about it.",stripperwriter,1502408239,t3_6sn2sc,t3_6sn2sc,3,0,dlg8nk2,sex,37,0.08108108108108109

"Also think this is incorrect. It's not only the level of hormones that determines an athlete's ability, it's also their physical development. (Among other things eg. Skills training, genetics, etc.) That is, the average person who developed as a male through puberty and training is going to be more physically adept than the same person (assuming all other factors being the same) developing as a female through puberty. This means that, even if they have exactly the same hormone levels at 25 years old, the male through puberty would have a physical advantage. This is the same for pro athletes. It's not only their only current hormone levels that give them an advantage but their past development as a result of their hormones.

Many supporters, although you are correct not all, criticized Clinton for appearing beholden to Wall Street interests. I think this appointment creates similar issues.The other interesting thing to me is your argument that Clinton was beholden to Wall Street when Trump merely knows them. But do we have any evidence of quid pro quo between Clinton and banks? Her policies were much harsher on the banks (regulatory action) vs Trump who believes in deregulation.

"The lack of a public option is one problem, but the bigger problem is the cost of the underlying medical treatments.  Without fixing the underlying cost problems (which are structurally built into an extremely broken healthcare legislation environment), a single payer system will fail miserably.I've argued for the months I've been on this board that the most serious cost problems should be fixed first before a single payer is considered.  If the govt wants to attempt to do both of these at the same time, then at a minimum I would want the following changed:  No pharma advertising.  Allow reimbursement of foreign pharmaceuticals (at least from Canada).  Let Medicare negotiate drug prices.  Get rid of the donut hole.  If federal funding is used to help bring a drug to market that is ultimately successful, the company should repay the government at least some of the money, or some type of royalty.  encourage generic competition including biologics (which ACA actively discourages).  I'd also like something like NICE.Im a bit skeptical that the price problems can be fixed competently and that's why I'm hesitant to support single payer right now.

This is not particularly surprising given that [THC (and CBD) is a positive allosteric modulator of opioid receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16489449) 93% of participants report that they prefer cannabis to opiates.  Not too surprising given that 92% stated that they at least agree (or strongly agree) that the side effects experienced from cannabis are more tolerable than those experienced from opiates.  There were similar self-reported efficacy results comparing OTC analgesics to cannabis as well.  No mention of side effects, though.  This is not particularly surprising given that OTC analgesics are not known for perceivable side effects. I would like to see the question/results comparing cannabis side effects to OTC analgesic side effects.  Without it, I think the paper is *slightly* slanted, although minimally.  This is an interesting study on self-reported efficacy of cannabis in comparison to common analgesics.  Much more work needs to be done on this topic, but it is refreshing to see these types of studies to counter/support the common anecdotal evidence that most people hear.",BlackTieButtPlug,1498685866,t3_6k39hf,t3_6k39hf,2,0,djj3hj1,science,2,1.0

"Message from UF presidentAug. 16, 2017 Dear Campus Community: Amid serious concerns for safety, we have decided to deny the National Policy Institute’s request to rent event space at the University of Florida. This decision was made after assessing potential risks with campus, community, state and federal law enforcement officials following violent clashes in Charlottesville, Va., and continued calls online and in social media for similar violence in Gainesville such as those decreeing: “The Next Battlefield is in Florida.” I find the racist rhetoric of Richard Spencer and white nationalism repugnant and counter to everything the university and this nation stands for. That said, the University of Florida remains unwaveringly dedicated to free speech and the spirit of public discourse. However, the First Amendment does not require a public institution to risk imminent violence to students and others. The likelihood of violence and potential injury – not the words or ideas – has caused us to take this action. Warm Regards,W.

"I'm mostly the same, listen to NPR in the car, watch PBS, TDS is entertainment and sometimes the guests are really good. I don't like TYT because every time I watch them, they seem to disregard history and context for what they are talking about. They were saying how the Democrats were weak for not passing greater health care reform in 2009/2010, and that they were tired of the party paying lipservice to people when they said that they were trying to reach a compromise. I found that claim so absolutely egregious that I could not take them seriously thereafter. The best argument to the contrary would be that Lieberman wouldn't even vote for the government option, but that's neither here nor there. That's the issue that really turned me completely off their channel. I don't think they appreciate context, and would rather paint a picture that suits their narrative.

It's amazing isn't it how Christians have played the victim and oppressed card well before these modern times.   Take a look at [this one](http://www.misterkitty.org/extras/stupidcovers/bias4.jpg)	It's so ridiculous that it should be satire.   It's even just a outright lie too.  The reason why this problem exists in the first place is because Christianity is persecution complex religion. Which goes to show you one of the major errors of Christianity to begin with.  Clearly the authors of the new testament never thought the faith would become dominant in any region for verses like the above to be true.    So every time a Christian declares America (or any other nation) a Christian nation they are greatly contradicting their own religion.   While on the flip side they often try to play the victim card at the same time anyways.  I really wish I could understand the thought process of a theist who lies for their religion.   I seem completely unable to look at it from their side of the fence because the moment I feel I have to lie to defend or advocate for something than it's simply not worth my time to begin with.

"If anyone feels the need to recreate this, here is a sandcastle maker's essential tools: a bucket and a complete set of plastic cutlery with a knife, spoon, and fork.You need the bucket to haul water and wet sand inland, as a common mistake among most people is to build directly near the source of wet sand. This is a mistake when the tide starts to roll in and eats away at your base or the water starts to soak the upper floors of the castle. If you build further inland, the wet sand will evaporate and turn dry, essentially hardening and strengthening it. Make use of beach materials, from rocks to sticks of driftwood. Most people use them for flair, but you should use them for structural integrity, laying them inside the sandcastle build to help keep it upright and sturdy. And of course there is your set of plastic cutlery, which you would be surprised at how much use you could get out of. Spoons can dig out little pockets, fords can add texture, knifes can help make clean cuts, and on all of your tools the flat side of the handle can be used as a long trowel to smooth, with the end of each tool being useful as a way to carve in detail or plaster in small bits of wet sand in hard to reach areas.There are much more advance ways to get your builds done, such as using paper cones or water cups to help shape molds to more advance tools such as a cheese slicer, palette knives, or spray bottle.

"This is from an old post I made months ago about Islam.I was shared this story by an ex-Muslim in a YouTube comment thread.Farag Foda was a prominent Egyptian professor, killed by authorization from Islamic clerics of Al-azhar University, because he published books exploring the real Islamic history and how ugly it was and advocating for a new secular Egypt where everyone is equal, and 'Western' human rights would exist.It was a politically motivated murder, one of over 200, in order to preserve Sharia law.He was assassinated June 8th, 1992 in Cairo.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farag_Fodahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1tBMQG-OvsInterview with Islamic cleric who called for Foda's death.   Abu Al-‘Ela Abd Rabbo--What was the religious justification for the assassination of Farag Foda?The punishment for an apostate is death, even if he repents.  If someone curses Allah or the Prophet in public, he should be punished by death.  The punishment for apostasy is death.  --Who is entrusted with carrying out this punishment?If there is a just Muslim ruler, or even a tyrannical one who implements the punishments decreed by Allah, he should carry out this punishment.  But if that is not the case, and the ruler does not implement the sharia, any of the citizens is entitled to carry out Allah’s punishment.--What about the children of Farag Foda, who see you now enjoying your freedom?  Don’t you respect their feelings?  After all, you killed their father.With all due respect, you must stop using these venomous methods, aimed at provoking the viewers’ sentiments…--These are not venomous methods…  Before you talk about Foda’s family, let me ask you if you were not harmed by someone who cursed the Prophet and his wives, what gives you greater pain and sorrow?  If you say that it is Farag Foda, then you should re-examine your faith.  But if you say it is the attacks on the Prophet, his wives, and the Koran, then you have answered your own question.

"You lose some content, true, but the question is how much you care about that particular content.For example, I don't really mind that I'm missing The Walking Dead, and probably wouldn't watch it if I had AMC.You can also usually buy most of this content directly, as long as you don't mind waiting until the season is finished. For example, right now I can buy season 7 of The Walking Dead on Amazon for $35. It would cost me more than that to have cable for one month.

"Or maybe ""Jamal"" projects poorness, whereas ""Greg"" is neutral. The problem I have with these studies is they don't seem to account for SES. There are low SES white names, but they're never included in these studies. Would ""Billy-Bob"" or ""Cletus"" do as well as ""Greg""? How would they compare to ""Jamal""? In America, Black people make up a disproportionate amount of the poor. The poor Black community also seem to be the most likely to give their kids a ""Black name"". So are employers rejecting them because they are ""Black"", or is that just an indicator of SES, which is what they're really biased against?And lastly, do ""Black names"" actually correlate with stereotypes such that they *should* factor into the decision on a resume? I can only speak for my own experience, but yes. Names aren't randomly assigned. They tell you a little about the environment the child grew up in. A trashy name usually means a trashy upbringing. It's not exclusive to ""Black names"", either. There are white names that set off red flags for people.

Keep in mind we still import 25% net of the oil we use [source](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=32&amp;t=6). So while we may be more energy rich it's in things like natural gas.Exploration for oil allows us to find alternative sources of oil so when oil shale extraction becomes uneconomical these more traditional sources might still be economical. We might also lessen our need to import 52% of our oil from OPEC/Persion gulf countries [source](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&amp;t=6).

"From what I've read, the material used for lab-grown meat is taken from a biopsy. Biopsies are common practices in veterinary and human medicine. Most tend to cause very little pain (small amounts of discomfort for animals with thicker skin) and only remove small amounts of tissue. Depending on the source of tissue, the cows used for the extraction could still face common farming or factory farming practices, which could still be a cause of ethical issues. The cows would likely be in those conditions regardless of whether or not they have their tissues sampled.As somebody who cares about environmental issues as well as the treatment of animals, the animals used for lab-grown meat are a necessary sacrifice (at least from my perspective). Many people are vocal about their unwillingness to even try a plant-based diet. Lab-grown meats are a way for people to willingly reduce the environmental impact of animal agriculture and the amount of animals subjected to life on factory farms.

"Praise be to Allaah.Allaah has commanded the one who wants to pray to wear his adornment. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes) while praying [and going round (the Tawaaf of ) the Ka‘bah] and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allaah) likes not Al‑Musrifoon (those who waste by extravagance)”[al-A’raaf 7:31] The scholars regard the minimum level of adorning oneself to be covering the ‘awrah. Hence they stated that covering the ‘awrah is one of the necessary conditions of prayer being valid, and prayer is not valid unless the ‘awrah is covered. **What is implied by their saying “covering the ‘awrah” is that what is obligatory is covering the ‘awrah, and that no matter what is used to cover the ‘awrah, the prayer is valid, even if it is a tight garment that shows the shape of the ‘awrah. **This is what have been stated clearly by the scholars of the various schools of fiqh (madhhabs). There follow their comments on that. 1 – The Hanafi madhhab: **It says in al-Durr al-Mukhtaar (2/84): It does not matter if it clings to the body and shows the shape of the body. End quote – i.e., the garment that one wears when praying. Ibn ‘Aabideen (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on al-Durr al-Mukhtaar: The phrase “It does not matter if it clings to the body”, such as if it clings to the buttocks, but if it is thick and the colour of the skin cannot be seen through it, but it clings to the limb and shows its shape so that the shape of the limb is visible, then that does not mean that the prayer is not permissible, because the ‘awrah is still covered. End quote from Ibn ‘Aabideen.** 2 – The Shaafa’i madhhab: **al-Nawawi (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Majmoo’ (3/176): If the colour is concealed but the size of the limb can be seen, such as the knee or buttocks and so on, the prayer is valid because the ‘awrah has been covered. Al-Daarimi and the author of al-Bayaan stated that it is not valid if the shape can be seen, but this is an obvious mistake. End quote from al-Nawawi.** 3 – The Maaliki madhhab: It says in al-Fawaakih al-Dawaani, 1/216: **“It is valid if a man prays in a single garment”: that is subject to the recommended condition that it should be thick enough so that it does not show anything, otherwise it is makrooh, and it should cover all of his body. If it covers only the ‘awrah that is most private, or it shows the shape of the ‘awrah, then it is makrooh to pray in it, and the prayer should be repeated if there is enough time left. End quote.** ****It is mentioned that it is makrooh to pray in a garment that shows the shape of the ‘awrah, not that it is haraam.**** It says in Haashiyat al-Dasooqi that praying in a garment that shows the shape of the ‘awrah is valid, but it is slightly makrooh, and it is mustahabb to repeat the prayer if there is enough time left. It says in Balghat al-Saalik (1/283): **It is essential that the material be thick i.e., it not be see-through at a glance, and it should not be see-through at all, or it may be see-through when staring at it.  If it is see-through at a glance, then it is as if it was not there (i.e., it is as if he is praying naked, because he is not covered). But if it is see-through when staring at it then he should repeat the prayer if there is time, as when the clothing shows the shape of the ‘awrah, because praying in such a garment is makrooh according to the correct view. End quote. **4 – The Hanbali madhhab al-Bahooti (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Rawd al-Murabba’ (1/494):  It is not a condition that the garment should not show the shape of the body or part of the body, because this cannot be avoided.  Ibn Qaasim (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in his commentary on al-Rawd al-Murabba’, commenting on the words of al-Bahooti quoted above: that is in agreement with the three imams, Abu Haneefah, Maalik and al-Shaafa’i (may Allaah have mercy on them); i.e., the view of Imam Ahmad concerning this matter is in accordance with the view of the three other Imams. **Ibn Qudaamah (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in al-Mughni (2/287): If it conceals the colour but shows the shape, the prayer is permissible, because this cannot be avoided. End quote.** Al-Mardaawi said in al-Insaaf (1/471): Al-Majd ibn Taymiyah said: it is makrooh for a woman to tie something over her clothes (such as a belt), lest that show the size of her limbs and body. Ibn Tameem and others said: it is makrooh for a woman to pray with something tied around her waist such as a wrapper or belt, etc. End quote. Shaykh Sayyid Saabiq (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Fiqh al-Sunnah (1/97): It is obligatory to wear garments that cover the ‘awrah even if it is tight and shows the shape of the ‘awrah. End quote. These are the comments of the scholars on praying in tight garments that show the shape of the ‘awrah. They clearly state that the prayer is still valid. **But that does not mean that people are encouraged to pray in tight clothes, rather they should not wear tight clothes or pray in them, because that is contrary to the adornment that we are enjoined to wear when praying. Rather the issue here is whether the prayer is valid or not.** Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan has issued a fatwa stating that if a **woman** prays in tight clothes that show the shape of her ‘awrah, her prayer is valid, although she is sinning by wearing these clothes. He said: It is not permissible to wear tight clothes which show the limbs and the shape of a woman’s body and buttocks. Tight clothes are not permissible for men or women, but it is especially forbidden for women, because the fitnah in their case is greater. With regard to praying in particular, if a person prays with his ‘awrah covered in such clothes, his prayer is valid in and of itself, because the ‘awrah is covered, but he is sinning by praying in tight clothes, because he has transgressed one of the prescribed requirements of prayer by wearing tight clothes. This is one aspect. Another aspect is that it is a cause of temptation and attracts attention, especially in the case of women. So women should cover themselves with loose garments which will cover them and not show any of the limbs of their body or attract attention. So it should not be a thin or see-through garment, rather it should be a concealing garment which will cover the woman completely. End quote. Al-Muntaqa min Fataawa al-Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan, 3/454 Some scholars have explained the words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), “Women who are clothed yet naked” as referring to women who wear tight clothes. https://islamqa.info/en/46529Also note the above is valid for women where the fitnah is much much greater.

"Kanye has been very popular and influential in his field, though his influence has not really reached outside of of rap/hiphop. And even in the rap world there's a stronger case to be made for the likes of Jay Z or Eminem, who brought rap to a much larger audience which Kanye took advantage of. And as an artist and manager Dr.Dre is a large part responsible for the rap industry as it is now.Outside of rap you have Beyonce who shaped popular music significantly over the 2000s, Coldplay which reinvigorated a whole brand of music, and despite not being as popular Bjork was hugely influential during the time.Overall though I would vote Eminem as more influential. Both in the way that he helped popularize rap with Suburban white culture and pioneered the mixing of different musics together in rap.Of course it's a bit difficult only having 17 years to measure the most influential individuals. It could be that Kanye will continue to have influence outside of wrap itself but as it stands while he's immensely popular, I don't see the musical influences that are necessary.Also in what way does Adele lack critical acclaim.Edit see also here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_albums_of_the_2000s_(century)Kanye hasn't even made the chart at all- his best album is ~3.5M.

"To your first point, you believe that western cultures are as diverse with each other as they are to eastern? There is a stark difference between those lands which were conquered by the romans than say, Russia, China, and Non-Mediterranean Africa. Maybe India is closer because of its conquering by Britain, but it's still so much farther from the cultures of Western Europe than they are to each other. If for nothing else than religion and political structure. I'm not denying that there are differences between western cultures, I'm just saying those differences are minuscule when compared to differences between east and west. To list all the differences between western cultures, then list all the differences between east and west would be much too difficult for this here, but I can't see how you can possibly believe that those lists would be equal.And all of that ""American Dream"" stuff wasn't made by our founders, which was your initial point. You made it seem like that's what the US was founded on, and it's simply not true.

Even if I did, it wouldn't include all just the general distrust and contempt a multicultural society breeds. When one group is in power, it becomes natural for the dissenting party to blame everything, not on that one person, but on that whole culture.

Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?27 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?28 And why take ye thought for raiment?

"I mean. All you have to do is see that the very best motorcycle riders are qualifying in pole position, winning races, and setting lap records while taking turns (not all turns, just some) while kicking the back wheel out to know that it does, in fact, result in a faster lap. As you said, there are a ton of factors going into it but one major one that we can talk about is how it effects the corner exit. One type of racing line is [this](https://3yzdbi2wle6g3mkfml2sn936-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/The-Raing-Line1.jpg). You brake hard and shave off tons of speed before you start your lean in which comes relatively late into the curve. You start the turn super tight doing most of the turning in the beginning which allows you to get on the gas much earlier into the corner exit and come out of the turn deeper into your acceleration. Yeah, you had to brake harder and enter the turn slower than if you did a [""perfect"" turn](http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/Images/corner_racing-line-traditional.gif) but depending on what comes next on the race course the higher exit speed may be more beneficial than a higher average spend through the corner. When a rider kicks his back wheel out he is kinda taking the best of both worlds. He is able to enter the corner at a high speed but he uses the drift to aim his bike straighter out of the turn so his exit looks more like the high exit speed line. As a general rule of thumb if you are losing traction in a turn you're doing it wrong. You're definitely correct on that one. And the reasons I gave above may even be a load of bollocks. But when one of the best motorcycle riders on the entire world uses the drift to set lap records and win premier class championships... you can't say it doesn't work.",buddythegreat,1498338956,t3_6j9nem,t1_djcr0n1,3,0,djcserd,sports,816,0.0036764705882352936

"Just want to add that it's my understanding that the 'recovered' emails were found by more or less searching for ""To: HRC"" in the Dept. of State (and possibly other) email systems.  That is to say, they weren't ""forensically"" recovered with an undelete tool, but recovered by cross referencing systems and that's because Hillary took deliberate steps to make forensic recovery impossible.This method of course can't recover any 'work related' emails that went outside of the DoS (or gov't in general?) system, for instance any sent to lizard people from outer space can't be found.  Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence.It's also worth mentioning the extremely petty step Clinton's team took in printing the emails out on paper instead of providing the electronic records.  Makes it a lot harder to verify the integrity of the data, search it, etc. if you have to do it by hand.  It wasn't just that the laws were different - Colin Powell used a private email address (hosted by AOL, I think), not a private server, and he did it as a way to encourage the adoption of Email in the dept of state.

"I think so. You'll note in the linked article that Catholics are largely indistinguishable from non-religious people being polled on the issue. I would guess it's an issue of both perspective and doctrine. On the perspective side, obviously there's more recent history of persecution from which protestants are drawing from, particularly in the US, where many of them specifically fled to in order to avoid persecution (my own point of reference here is coming from a family that were historically, though not currently, Mennonites).On the doctrine side, I think many (most?) protestant denominations lean much harder on the text of the bible for their doctrine. They don't ascribe divine authority to anyone, like the Pope. Nor do they have as much history or ceremony in how they worship. [Edit] For the purposes of interpreting these poll results, it's probably also worth noting that many evangelicals do not actually consider Catholics to be Christians, and so likely do not consider the relative strength or status of the Catholic Church when someone asks them if they think Christians are persecuted.",captain_tedious,1489164794,t3_5ymjh1,t1_derbafy,2,0,derc83e,atheism,62,0.03225806451612903

"This isn't the test for whether something is a reasonable restriction on voting.Every additional hurdle to voting has marginal effects.  If you made it so that voters were only allowed to vote by crawling into the polling place on their hands and knees instead of walking, some people (probably older or fatter or disabled people who are less mobile) would be discouraged from voting.  If you made it so voting could only take place between the hours of 12am - 5am, some people (probably older people who aren't used to being awake during those hours, and people with jobs that require them to work during those times) would be discouraged from voting.  If you made it so voting could only take place in open-toed shoes, some people (probably disproportionately men) would be discouraged from voting.  Voting restrictions are not intended to make it impossible to vote, and reduce voting by 100%; they are intended to make it more costly to vote, and reduce voting by a smaller percentage (which may nonetheless make it harder for one party to win an election).  Fewer DMV locations mean voters have to drive further to get an ID, which mean some people won't do so.  Restricted DMV hours mean voters have to go between specific times, which means some people won't do so.  Fewer early voting locations means voters have to travel further to vote early, and are likely to face longer lines to vote early, which means some people won't do so.",skybelt,1480355301,t3_5faq3d,t1_daj82ge,82,0,daj8wmz,PoliticalDiscussion,329,0.2492401215805471

"What do you mean that people are ""battling you out to even things out?"" As the having it sooo easy part I think you misunderstand what people mean by white privilege. That being said I don't think people have done a good job with the messaging on that one. Basically we all have different privileges based on where we start out in life. Sometimes it's wealth. Sometimes it's a having a stable family life. Sometimes it's being born without a disability. Other times it's based on race. In the US, due to centuries of discrimination that never really ended on the institutional level, a lot of what happens in our life is because of our race or ethnicity. White is given preferential treatment by our society at the cultural and economic level. Just because you are white does not mean that you don't have any struggles. We're just saying that there are some struggles you don't have to deal with because you are white. This article does a good job of explaining this from a white perspective. I know it's a Huffpost article but this is from before they jumped the shark: http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5269255No one is denied promotions or scholarships for being white. Minorities take only 28% of scholarships which means they are underrepresented. Even for scholarships that give more to minorities like Pell Grants it evens out once you account for poverty. http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=134623124How does society celebrate hate against whites?",monkey678,1492221273,t3_65blfr,t1_dg9tn94,2,0,dga452r,Fuckthealtright,51,0.0392156862745098

"Civil servants and a free press will be important going forward, but there are other things your average citizen can do. - Get involved in local politics.      - Hold local meetups to organize.     - Participate in civil disobedience.      - Educate yourself on the issues. I'm talking more than superficial knowledge and understand the opposing views.       - Get inolved in your local community and be part of the change.

"Good question that I don't really have an answer too. As of now, the reason many in California (""liberals"" that are secretly extremely fiscal conservative) don't mind illegal immigrants is that they provide a huge pool of very cheap labor. The agricultural sector would utterly collapse if you deport the migrant workers, and the status quo is perfectly fine with a lot of us, and that's why we voted for Clinton.  The left's crying wolf is definitely part of the problem. They cried wolf and accused good, well-meaning men like McCain or Romney bigots, and now y'all won't listen when an actual bigot (Bannon more so than Trump) has taken power.The problem also lies with the many Republicans who refuse to recognize that yes, a lot of Trump's policies are ACTUALLY racist. And please stop attacking the ""media"" anytime you feel you're on the wrong side. The media exists to get ratings and stir up controversy (more clicks), not to push a liberal agenda. Think about their coverage of BLM. If they really were pushing a liberal agenda, they would plaster the airwaves with stories of Eric Garner or (that other guy in South Caroliina or something), black men who were definitely and undoubtedly innocent victims killed by police brutality.Instead, they chose to focus coverage on more ""gray"" incidents like Trayvon Martin's or Michael Brown's. Incidents where either the black victim/criminal or the white officer/murderer could be seen as the aggressor, depending on one's leanings and biases. Think about how they gave equal coverage to both Dylann Roof and that FB Live Chicago case where the black kids assaulted the mentally disabled white guy. The media is definitely guilty of inciting conflict, arguments, and division, but to say they were doing it out of ""liberal"" interests wouldn't be accurate.  You should note that very few people think that ALL GOP/conservatives are racist. The far left ""all white men are evil"" Tumblr-posting liberal is just as rare as the far right ""all blacks are welfare queens with low IQ's"" Breitbart reader. I'm Asian, and the biggest form of racism that has impacted my own life is the left's affirmative action quotas, which punish Asians more than it does whites... And that gun would've let you, perhaps, injure one or two Communist soldiers before being butchered. Not much better of a result, no? Your counter points focus more on defense against foreign invaders.The ""tyranny"" that the 2A means to prevent (at least from what I understand) seems to be more of defending against an internal over-reaching government sorta thing, which is an obsolete idea in the modern age.   Honestly, I don't know what's best for the US. There are so many guns in circulation, total/effective gun control like we have in Korea would be too difficult to achieve. I have lived in Dallas, so I do know that a total lack of gun control doesn't necessarily make a neighborhood dangerous. Something does need to change, though.  Not too familiar with the specifics, but California is a pretty big (and therefore inefficiently run) state.Welfare would be a big one, agricultural subsidies, etc. One thing that hits near and dear to me is financial aid, since the UC system forces Bay Area middle class families like mine to subsidize poor Hispanics from LA and poor white kids from the Central Valley.",goredsox69,1485917010,t3_5qw5o4,t1_dd681m8,1,0,dd69fll,PoliticalDiscussion,287,0.003484320557491289

"Gender identity is related to gender roles, and in many ways it comes from gender norms.  But it's not the same thing as gender norms.Think about it this way: you glance at people hundreds of times a day and, without thinking about it, assume their gender.  This is an automatic, implicit thing that everyone does.  Very young children do this.  It's INCREDIBLY basic, and it's one of the first ways we think about any given person we meet.But how?  We usually can't see their sex organs, so we go by norms.  We know pretty much how men and women present themselves in out culture.  This knowledge is very detailed and can be very nuanced: it's all in a context.  The same traits can identify a butch woman or a masculine man, depending on what other traits they're in context with.So there's two things here: a rich tapestry of gender norms, and a harsh, binary identification: MAN/WOMAN.  We use the former to determine the latter, and determining someone's binary gender, as I said, is very socially important and basic.  So it's an important way we think of OURSELVES, too.So, it doesn't make sense to think that transgenderness somehow rigidifies the connection of specific gender roles to specific genders.  The overall identification is a hammer: it's a big, important, encompassing way of feeling.  Specific norms are much more nuanced, and they can interplay with one gender or another without affecting the first thing I just said.",PreacherJudge,1494136088,t3_69plnp,t3_69plnp,2,0,dh8gism,changemyview,14,0.14285714285714285

"Most rabbis will only turn away people for good reason, like an Orthodox rabbi won't convert someone who isn't keeping kosher and has no plans to accept the mitzvot.  As long as a would-be convert does the requirements for their respective strain of Judaism, they will be able to convert.The reason a rabbi has to do it is because people need a teacher.  They have to learn about Judaism before they can do the necessary rituals to become Jewish, like a mikvah and bris/hatafat dam bris.  There is also generally (not so sure about Reform) a beit din, a rabbinical court, to determine the candidate's sincerity, their commitment to mitzvot, etc.  Conversions are usually only rejected inter-denominationally, so a Reform or Conservative conversion isn't recognized by the Orthodox and not all Reform conversions are recognized by Conservative. And no, it is not possible to be a Jew without going through the conversion process.  You could go to a synagogue and act like a Jew, but you could not be called for an aliyah or be considered Jewish for halakhic purposes.",aggie1391,1497563237,t3_6hi559,t3_6hi559,9,0,diyi75r,Judaism,17,0.5294117647058824

"There have been studies showing that having kids causes a significant decline in marital satisfaction. I don't have references, but Gottman talks about them occasionally in his books.His theory is that happy marriages are based on a foundation of knowing about your partner's life (e.g. who their friends are, what their favorite food is, what emotional vulnerabilities they have, etc.), feeling and expressing mutual fondness and admiration, and turning toward bids for attention (e.g. your partner says ""hey, look at that cool bird"" and you actually look at it and comment on it).Young kids can disrupt a lot of that, and it's not really their fault because they can't take care of themselves and they can't be independent for long stretches of time, which cuts down on husband and wife quality time.I'm not saying having kids is a death sentence for a marriage or anything because that is obviously untrue, but if you don't take time to respond to your partner's bids for attention after having kids *and* you don't know how vital that is to marriage, then you're in for a world of hurt you didn't see coming.",goatcoat,1501002794,t3_6pfgoz,t1_dkoxsjr,108,0,dkpc5v0,science,114,0.9473684210526316

I don't know what his path will be, if it's college, great, if it's trade school, great, if it's buying a Papa John's or a duplex to generate income, great. Common wisdom is sending kids down the wrong path. If I had to start over, I'd probably do trade school in HVAC, garage doors or as an electrician's apprentice and then start my own company after gaining experience. My dad wanted me to go that path because he didn't think I would get my shit together in college, but thankfully I did. The number of college grads pouring coffee at Starbucks or waiting tables is mind boggling and even careers in STEM can be bad because the employers are slashing guys over 40 for fresh out of college kids and H1B employees. In terms of women, I know it's easier said than done, but if you truly find a good one with a heart of gold, roll with it. Even if you can slay a new chick every other weekend, the thought of eating breakfast alone on Sunday mornings or not having a family on Thanksgiving or Christmas is awful in my opinion. But I say that as a guy who has lucked into a fantastic relationship, I'm sure my tune would be different had I spent the last nearly 20 years single with just a bunch of post wall alpha widows in my dating pool now.",skankhunt-yon-juu-ni,1479060833,t3_5cnr64,t3_5cnr64,1,0,d9ynwyh,TheRedPill,29,0.03448275862068965
"While it's true that there is probably some level of UBI that would stimulate lots of people to eschew working in favor of collecting that free paycheck, this probably isn't true at or around the minimum wage.Consider the difference in effort that already exists between the lowest-skill workers (GED equivalent or less) and those who tend to make more money (college degrees).  Every student has the choice to skip high school and save themselves at least 8 years of studying by taking a retail job.  Many don't, because they experience one or more of the following motivations:1. The opportunity to make more money by earning more academic credentials.1. The pursuit of a career that would be meaningful for them.1. The feeling of reaching their potential.Of these motivations, only the first would be affected by a UBI, and only if the difference between their earnings before and after college became small.  The rest of the people would still be motivated to pursue their goals, and may actually be able to do so more fervently because they would have less student loans to worry about thanks to their UBI.",NigNagNug,1498496612,t3_6jma0l,t3_6jma0l,5,0,djfamml,changemyview,148,0.03378378378378378

"That's our concept of God. Plus, its not impossible for The Omnipotent. Yes. So now, if randomly 'X' event happens, it becomes the **permanent** consequence (aka, ""future"" - if viewed from the past).

And all other alternative futures are now unreal.And if this consequence is now viewed by someone who is also existent in the past **at the same time**, then it becomes His knowledge. From our perspective, past is happening before the future.

The press would be incompetent not to cover his self made blunders, but for some reason his supporters take this as an attack. What kills me about trump and his supporters is the downright hypocrisy. I watched a lot of his campaign speeches and listened to his rhetoric, and find it amazing that he cries foul whenever he gets negative attention. This guy literally made enemies of his own party, the dnc, the media and numerous celebs and citizens, but for I guess trump and supporters expect everyone to forget about that and treat trump with kiddie gloves??

"And yours is such an unthinking knee-jerk reaction to a very real solution for many people who complain about their situation.People who make (and survive) on 20k a year are probably not living in a particularly expensive apartment, nor do they have an enormous amount of worldly possessions to cart to the town over.  A 26 foot UHAUL is literally $60 to rent for a day, and can easily fit a 2BR apartment worth of crap.  You don't even have to take it back to the original place you rented it from.This guy is posting on Reddit, so he has access to the internet.  This means it is absolutely trivial for him to find a new living situation, and he's apparently not homeless, so he has the benefit of planning ahead.  The same can be said for a change in employment.  $10/hr for a full time job says he has no real marketable skills, but it's also not hard to find a replacement $10/hr job pretty much anywhere.  So now you're just talking about the fact that it doesn't feel nice to move away from his friends and family.  Well, first of all, if he has a lot of nearby friends and family, the other items you were bitching about should also be relatively easy to overcome.  Friends will help you move.  Family will float you the security deposit for your new apartment until you get the return from your old one.  Odds are friends AND family have jobs, and might be able to refer you somewhere.Maybe you can't walk over to your friend's house for D&amp;D night anymore.

"Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that. Not in the same situation (breakup wise) as you right now, but I was (and still am tbh but very very slightly getting better) in a similar situation in terms of feeling lost and not being able to do anything productive a few weeks ago. And definitely very angry about how much I did for him while he didn't do the same for me. I'm sort of (?) getting better now- one thing that really helped me was this (https://youtu.be/ovZVRnr6ySc) video by Dodie Clark. It mostly consists of very obvious things, but it was quite 'pleasant' for me to have all the ""advice"" + some reassurance in one video. I've also started a 'habit tracker' which includes (among other things I'd like to achieve this month) not unblocking him and his current ""gf"" (yeah, that's how the break up happened) and checking their social media accounts all the time. I know it's ironic and sad that I'm doing this despite my ultimate goal being that I don't think about him at all. However, it really does help me stay away from seeing how he's doing currently and helps me know that yes, I still am thinking about him every day, but the thoughts are completely based on what I knew about him in the past (since I have no idea what/ how he's been doing recently). And doing that every day for a while assures my brain, in some weird way, that he was in my life only in the past and he belongs in the past. (Also, it's really satisfying/ gives a tiny sense of accomplishment to tick off/colour in a box and to try to consider this whole process as any other daily life thing that I do.) I really do understand the feeling of being lost, especially when you've been planning/ imagining pretty much everything in your future with them in mind. But after a few days/weeks/months, depending on yourself and your situation, you really do start to see a (blur of a) future again, one that does not include them (at least not with them being the main character in your story).

But it takes extreme heat/pressure for gold to become pure. This is a test to see how patient you'll be and how much you'll hold onto faith, do you really want it? I believe you do.

"This question comes up a lot, so I'll paste part of a previous reply I made to someone else:You can easily see many stars of the Milky Way, and on very dark nights in remote areas you can even see some of the clouds.  However, you won't see all the colors like in OP's pic.  The reason for this has to do with the structure of your eyes.When you look at the sky, your eyes need to constantly shift and refocus to take in all the parts of it. But the receptors in your eyes are arranged in a way that low-light objects (like stars) can't be seen well when you look straight at them. So you will see parts of the Milky Way out of the corner of your eye, but when you shift focus to look right at them, they'll fade from view. It's difficult to stare at distinct parts the way you can in the photo.You can see this just by looking at an individual star. Look just to the side of a star and you will see it in your peripheral vision. Now look directly at it -- its brightness will fade. So it's hard to get a direct look at some of the dimmer objects in the night sky.At the same time, the receptors in your eyes that detect color need bright light to be activated, so it is very difficult to see distinct, vibrant colors in low light.  Cameras can get around that with special sensors, long exposures, and post-processing.  As long as photographers don't go overboard with processing, these sort of photos are an accurate representation of what the Milky Way looks like, even if we can't see it quite the same way ourselves.**tl;dr:** Yes, it really looks like this, but because of the anatomy of your eyes, you won't see it quite the same way.",logarrhythmia,1496677699,t3_6fdghf,t1_diherxe,16,0,dihm16d,EarthPorn,214,0.07476635514018691

"Just based on the clip above (I didn't see the full interview on CNN), I don't think we ought to say that Cooper was way out of line here.  I think Beck is right.  The alt-right, being a largely online-based group, isn't as well known as say, the tea party back in 2008.  As a result, like Beck says, we need to be precise in how we discredit them by linking them to racism and white nationalism at the risk of alienating a lot of people who would just be exasperated by claims of racism being thrown around again.  And then Cooper asks a clarifying question saying, in so many words, that the concern is that fears of the alt-right will be written off without looking into what they stand for and how they are centralizing influence.  I think people on this sub are more attuned to the alt-right than many CNN viewers (especially the older crowd), so if this discussion between Beck and Cooper was just ""the alt-right sucks and is racist"" it would get a lot less traction than it would by Cooper being a journalist and asking these questions.

"It will probably be awkward. Maybe you'll lose your erection, or come too soon, or not know what to do. **Don't let it get to you.** Sex isn't about perfection. Sex is about expressing your enjoyment of each other and your care for each other. At times sex may be transcendant, or comforting, or animalistic, or just sating a need, but it's always about the two of you enjoying doing things with each other. It's not a performance, and nobody's rating you.She knows you're not experienced. It'll take you a while to learn how she responds, what she likes (and even if you'd been with other women, you'd still have to learn how *she* responds— women can be pretty different). It's just like the rest of your relationship. Over the years you'll be together, you'll always be learning more about each other; whether it's that she cries over that kind of movie, or likes that kind of food, or comes like a steam train when you do that to her g-spot, it's part of what makes a long-term relationship so rewarding. If you knew everything on day 1, it wouldn't be nearly  as great.There's a lot of concrete practical advice for virgins out there— do this, don't do that, etc. It's worth reading, and it's always worth learning ways to improve your sex life whether it's your honeymoon or whether you've been together for 20 years. But I think the bedrock secret to being a good lover is the same as the secret to the rest of the relationship: paying sincere attention to her, listening to her spoken and unspoken and unconscious responses, doing your absolute best for her without sacrificing who you are. Keep to that, and even your crummier, disappointing sex will still be pretty darn good.",Problem119V-0800,1502699233,t3_6tjx40,t3_6tjx40,5,0,dlli39s,sex,17,0.29411764705882354

"The FBI has been entrapping vulnerable people for a very long time. When this all started, many of us just saw headlines about the FBI saving us all from the scary terrorists on a regular basis. It took a while to find out their methods. What really brought this to light for me was HBOs documentary called The Newburgh Sting. You can still see it on HBO today. It's about an FBI informant setting up several poor African American men who have zero political preferences and no intention of violence by luring them in with promises of a whole lot of money. One of these men was a Muslim, but you'll see that he even tried to resist the FBI informant. This informants name is Shahed Hussain. He has been setting up innocent people for the FBI since he got caught in a scam while working at the DMV in early 2000. Here's a timeline of his activities.http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/07/shahed-hussain-fbi-informant/This fucking guy is the scum of the earth. He is STILL setting people up to this day. He shows up in these cases all the time. If this interests you, you may want to also watch the documentary called (T)error which actually documents one of these FBI stings from the informants perspective. After seeing all this evidence, it really makes me wonder how many of these terrorist attacks we see in the US would of happened without the FBI radicalizing and arming these people themselves.How many times have we heard about the FBI already interviewing people BEFORE they committed an atrocity??Here's some examples...Boston Bombers - http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-interviewed-dead-boston-bombing-suspect-years-ago/San Bernadino - https://www.google.com/amp/abcnews.go.com/amp/US/san-bernardino-shooter-contact-people-fbis-radar-sources/story%3Fid%3D35566967Orlando massacre - https://www.google.com/amp/www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-fbi-investigation-mateen-20160712-snap-story,amp.htmlSandy Hook - https://www.google.com/amp/www.newsweek.com/day-fbi-knocked-adam-lanzas-door-226657%3Famp%3D1Oklahoma Bombing - http://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-feds-knew-before-okla-bombing/Fort Hood shooting- http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/08/nidal-hasan-anwar-awlaki-emails-fbi-fort-hood/Could this all be coincidence, or are the FBI just that terrible at their jobs?

"I am going to sort of agree here for two different reason. Children are a huge environmental drain and one of the worst things you can do for environment. Additionally, for awhile I have been confused on why people want many kids, like more than three. It seems like they are 'collecting' instead of actually raising kids. It's incredible hard to have a meaniful relationship with many children. How do you really get to know 6 kids and have a worth while relationship with them. Just my experience but usually when I hear people talk that are from families with many children, they had a minimal relationship with their parents. Especially the youngest one. Additionally the oldest are usually stuck with raising the younger ones instead of enjoying being a teen or 20 something and building their life. I disagree with having many children for many reason. It is not my place to tell people what to do but we should totally have a discussion about it.",emash1994,1493330388,t3_67ucpw,t3_67ucpw,5,0,dguaxgp,TwoXChromosomes,31,0.16129032258064516

"I don't think his writing is sexist - as in he thinks of women as subpar humans. There are some issues - let's not talk about the whole "" you can tell when a woman is happy by her nipples being erect,"" LOL - but I think people get sidetracked by certain things and ignore others.Most of his women characters are incredibly intelligent, independent, empowered and sex-positive, strong, capable, willing to fight (sometimes even kick-ass), and also caring and emotional and loving. They come in diverse shapes and sizes and most of them are pretty but not gorgeous. And yes, they often want to have children. When did it become a bad thing to want to be a mother? Or a bad thing to make caring for children a priority?BUT - they also humor the men around them. Like Ginger Rogers doing everything Fred Astaire can do but backwards and in high heels, while letting him ""lead,"" Heinlein's women are very careful not to crush the male egos of their partners. They are manipulative, because they understand men much better than the men understand women, so why not if it keeps everyone happy? The men feel important while the women quietly get the shit done.While Jubal is shouting ""Front!"" and being the face of his empire and a cranky and eccentric old man, his three assistants are running his entire life - from writing his books for him to running his financial empire to knowing every law on the books and having perfect memory - and they pat him on the head and praise him occasionally, which puffs him up even though he knows deep down it's bullshit. It's like this unspoken conspiracy between them all to just keep things running smoothly and everyone's happy.And of course, Mike teaches Jill and all the others without any bias at all, the women learn the quickest. In most of his books, the men try to ""protect"" the women physically, and boss them around, and mansplain quite a bit - to which the women proceed to protect themselves, ignore all the commands, and roll their eyes at the info-dumping of facts they already know, often correcting the men, and sometimes genuinely listening and learning quickly. The men respect the women, and often acknowledge their tendency to revert to cavemen at times of stress.Anyways, maybe I gave you a slightly different perspective on some of the things Heinlein was trying to portray with his characters.

"I already posted this on a different thread in r/politics, but I feel I should do so here again: - - - - -Here’s some context that may explain this outcome and why the boycott ‘not to participate’ might be relevant and meaningful. It seems every time the Pro-Statehood party comes in they make a referendum to determine what the island wants. An opinion poll if you will. The ballot then gets ‘Statehood’ and ‘Independence’. The real options, however, are Statehood or Commonwealth, but the current Commonwealth is a mess and even the party that supports the Commonwealth thinks it should be modified. The problem is that the Commonwealth party hasn’t gotten their shit together on how to modify it. The Pro-Statehood party takes advantage of this mess. In the **1998** Referendum, the original options were (1) Current Commonwealth, (2) Free Association *(which no one had no idea what the hell that meant)*, (3) Statehood, and (4) Independence. This was seen as an attempt to split the Commonwealth party and after much bickering they added a 5th option: ‘None of the above’, and the Commonwealth rallied behind this one. The result was that Statehood got 46.5%, ‘None of the Above’ got 50.3%. **2012** it was another clusterfudge. There was no ‘None of the Above’ option, but the Commonwealth supporters were not happy with what was supposed to be their option. Out of 1,878,969 people what went to vote, 834,191 voted for Statehood. That’s 44% of people that went to vote that voted for Statehood. This is where it gets even more interesting. 515,115 of those ballots were empty of invalid, only 454,786 voted for Free Association. People wanted to vote, but by dropping it blank, they were trying to send a message of ‘this is bullshit’. * Statehood: 834,191* Free Association: 454,786* Blank of Invalid: 515,115* Total ballots: 1,878,969Of the available options, Statehood got 61% of the votes if you discount blank ballots, but only 44% if you consider that the act of going to vote is sending a message and voicing your opinion. So basically, depending on how you read things, Statehood both won AND/OR lost. So now in **2017** the island is doing it all over again. So saying ‘fuck this shit, I’m staying home’ is a natural progression. It is important to note that Puerto Rico has historically a very high turnout. In 2012 turnout was 78%. A turnout of 27% in the 2017 is a very big deal when you take that into account. One of the political parties actively campaigned for the boycott as a means to send the message that it was all a pointless waste of time.

"Well certainly no one is proposing that they enforce any law. They do need to follow the law. Is harboring criminals not crime itself?

I would also note, as have others, that these universities are almost never completely private. So to directly address your concern, I think it's easy to imagine this as private issue but in reality the public often does have a vested interest. Abortion at Planned Parenthood is a very similar issue, and laws exist to ensure public funds are not used for such practices. They are neither fully private nor fully public. I think, in agreeance with your sentiment, that this method of funding has the potential to invite government interference into private realms.

"* Removing any ideological differences I think tactically the DNC wasn't very savvy both during the campaign and at the convention, but was also too sidelined and not listened too during the general by the Clinton campaign in regards to how and where to campaign.* Since I wasn't here during the convention or general I haven't gone through enough information to form an opinion on that yet.* I think what we all expected was to support any progressives we saw down ballot and prepare to push Clinton left as President. Of course, that's not what turned out to be the case.* I think big event's like the Women's march have provided ample opportunities for our community to make inroads with people who were more inclined to go with establishment politics or weren't big followers of politics in the first place. It's getting marchers and new political activists to ask the big questions beyond just how bad Tromp is; How did this happen? How did we get here? Why did our defenses not hold? How deep and how far back does this go? That's the most essential step.* Well as someone who believes in the need to dismantle the ideology of blaming the other so that we can have the interracial class based solidarity movement to free ourselves of our oligarchic oppressors, the need to talk with disillusioned White working class Trump voters is essential.

Dr. Marcoh shows up, and he has a philosopher's stone!! He offers to heal Mustang, and Roy accepts, with one catch. He's gotta use it on Havok first. :) Fuck yea!! It's great knowin those two are gonna be back to normal and able to carry on with their lives! The prospect of Mustang not being able to see Hawkeye again was quite depressing, and it's good to know that won't be the case! Scar is recovering from the battle after Olivier had rescued him. She recruits him under the watch of Major Miles to help rebuild Ishvall as well. The bit when Scar said that he had died twice already, and he was a different person since those times was awesome. He's come a long way as a character, and seeing him reconcile with his past, and be able to move on has been fantastic. Ed and Al are heading home. Damn if it doesn't feel good knowing these two are finally gonna be able to rest a while! Man, seeing Al with his body is so weird honestly, I just wish we would be able to have him around more. But its most def not a complaint. Just saying. :) Al is wondering about May too, who we see in a small flashback has gone back to Xing with Ling. Poor May! When she totally burst out crying that about broke my heart, but Ling promises to protect her clan at all costs, and she starts really crying. Man, that was great stuff right there! But back to Ed and Al. They have arrived back at the Rockbell's, and I was crying. Holy shit, that music in the background, and seeing Winry again had me all emotional. And then she embraces them, and it was such a beautiful moment. Words cannot express the awesomeness in scenes like this. The experience of having gone through such an awesome ride as these 64 episodes makes the emotional payoff of reunions like this so good. Soooooo good! Like holy shit good!! :)Skip ahead two years, and a few things have changed. Grumman is Fuhrer, Mrs. Bradley is raising Selim and Ed and Al are both heading off in opposite directions to do research and see the world. Well, we all know Al's real purpose for going to Xing. ;) Lol Ed is about to leave for the west, and he and Winry are at the train station. As Ed is about to board the train, he confesses his love for Winry using terms of equivalent exchange! XD haha! He did it! And Winry says to just take all of her! :P Hell yea guys!! Ed and Winry, and Al and May, both ships have successfully sailed! :) Fucking love it!!And Ed is on the train heading out. And we have a little monologue with him talking about overcoming and how you will rise even stronger. Kinda cheesy stuff, but the ride up to this point makes every fucking word so epic, and true. Ed's character has gone so far beyond any kind of shonen tropes, and developed so well, he truly has a heart that is Fullmetal. ;_; The tears wouldn't stop. Holy shit that was so good... best last line ever. And the end credits. Holy shit. I really like that second OP song, and the lyrics fit so fucking well. I was in tears the whole time. For real. Seeing each character as they had progressed was so satisfying. I could go on at length about them all, but I won't. That final pic with Ed, Winry, Al, May, Paninya, and Garfiel is pure icing. Like, super triple XXX sweet icing on top of the best cake ever. I could seriously look at that picture for hours and not stop smiling. Seeing them progress even farther in life is so freaking awesome, even if it's just one pic. May is so cute, and seeing Ed and Winry in the same kinda pose as Hohenheim and Trisha is so freaking great. I can't even describe it hardly. Suffice it to say, this episode was the absolute cherry on top of the desert. Couldn't ask for a better ending to such an epic series. I am left completely satisfied, except for the fact that it's over, obviously. :P This series will stick with me forever, and this episode allowed me to have a perfect capstone to it. Truly couldn't ask for more. :)",Monte_Carlo_1971,1481595052,t3_5i0svh,t3_5i0svh,59,0,db4hu93,anime,107,0.5514018691588785

"Preface: this is more long winded than I wanted and I dont mean to be pedantic.  I am sure you know much of this.  I just don't know how to make my perspective clear and balanced without it.  ...I don't know how they would teach it as a philosophy.  It's contextual and hard to define as any set of principles.  I am not sure it would please you, since many times conservatives have fought to maintain (actually) oppressive institutions for fear of change.The same problem exists with progressivism/leftism (i don't like to call them liberals because they are not though they came from that tradition here in the US as did the conservatives).  The progressives also fought for oppressive institutions, and that is rarely taught. The conservative movement really only galvanized with Buckley and was partly a reactionary movement, against the earlier progressive movement that had been ascendant throughout the first half of the century.   Before the rise of progressivism/conservatism, it seems, it was simply liberal (dictionary not American colloquial) vs illiberal in the US.   That's a very good point.  But... (screech), it seems to me, the southern evangelicals have way more power than the SJWs and antifa.  There is no significant antifa outside the campuses.  The SJWs have considerable power in the cities (especially western coast ones).  But... (screech), oppression does exist and the so called SJWs are often fighting for liberal/libertarian principles, though their reasons may not be coherent or valid.It's not all right and left.Libertarianism has almost nothing to do with conservatism.  There is occasional overlap as there may be with progressivism or the SJWs.  But the libertarian/liberal tradition is not one marked by fear of change.  Most want more change than I or Hayek are really comfortable and that's where I come back to Hayek's defense of conservatism in the essay.   Some hesitation concerning change is warranted, especially with these progressives or even libertarians who often want to throw out the baby with the bathwater and start new.  But we all need to quiet those and the parts of ourselves (I am guilty at times), who are consumed with hate.

"I've thought before that it was just like dogfighting or cockfighting how they use Pokemon. And I was kinda like, how can you do that to your buddies.On the other hand. It is a video game, you are supposed to suspend your common sense. You don't normally let 10 year old kids travel the world alone. You don't normally make a balloon explode and make team rocket fly off again, with them not receiving any lasting injuries (Falling down from the heights that Team Rocket is exploded to would definitely kill). Pokemon can be dangerous, you could have a pokemon that should definitely be a carnivore. However you never see half eaten dead pokemon laying around in the grass. Also it would be pretty important to know of the history of the pokemon world to make a claim on how that would work. The pokeball is an technological invention, how did society work before the pokeball was developed? And lastly, and most valid. Pokemon is created as a game, on the gameboy, it is therefore limited by it's design, because of the variation of pokemon, there are fish like magikarp and stuff. without a pokeball, how would these pokemon come along on a journey? Basically the pokemon world is flawed and doesn't make sense.

"You and I are in a similar situation.  I am an Engineer and very analytical.  (Raised Lutheran, became an Atheist, came back as a Methodist, married a Baptist, got ordained Independent Charismatic)  My wife is very artistic and ""spiritual"".  You will find God puts that mix together quite often.  They compliment each other quite will.  This yen-yang thing has a great deal of merit to it.  From our perspective, my wife has a prophetic gift.  She hears things and always has, even when she was Baptist.  However, the Holy Spirit is not the only entity out there that likes to communicate with prophetic people.  That is where my analytical gifts come into play.  On occasion I have had to be a guide and say ""that is not from God"".  What would seem very obvious to analytical types is not so with those that are artistic and spiritual.  A spiritual person is also more sensitive to demonic influence and good old emotionalism.  That is where you step in and take control (in a loving way).  Now on the flip side.  Almost every major screwed up decision I have made has been a result of not listening to my wife's guidance.  A spiritual person will bring a different perspective and should be given the utmost consideration in any decision.  Now, on to understanding Charismatics.  There are denominations that are Charismatic in their theology.  However, the charismatic movement transcends denominations.  You will find subsets in most major denominations.  There are a group of Baptists down the road that call themselves ""Bapticostals"".  A close friend of mine is a Roman Catholic priest that holds some incredible Charismatic services.  A Charismatic really just believes in the presence and movement of the Holy Spirit.  Once you realize that God is still just as much at work today as He was in the time of Christ, a brand new hope just fills your soul.  Anything is now possible.  Throw theology away.  Just read the Bible and let God guide you.  He did not write it for everyone, He wrote it for you.  Be blessed my friend.  If you need to chat, send me a message. One last comment.  I just read some of the other posts.  Don't listen or entertain that negative crap about your health.  If ever there was proof of the demonic, it is when someone feels the need to crush your hopes at point of your despair.  Know what is speaking through them and rebuke it.  Now, regarding your healing.  I do not know what God has planned for you, but I will leave you with this.Science has and still does find ways to cure people. (with God's help)Nature and Alternative has and still does find ways to cure people. (with God's help)God/Christ has and still does heal people.

"I don't think the censoring alone helps that much - in fact I recently argued against such censoring in an unrelated subreddit, because on the whole it's not that hard to come up with words or phrases that have the same meaning as those dissallowed. But I do think that when done as part of a larger strategy it is an effective tool for cutting back on vitriol. And I feel like the people who are turned off by the censoring of those words would also be turned off by a more holistic rule, like *don't make fun of people*. So I don't think you're wrong to say that they're becoming more isolated because of it, but you could say that they're just trying to stand up for what they believe in - and that really, any isolation isn't actively done by them, rather it's the people who are turned off by their ideas that isolate them.

"both have different purpose: 1. Headstand or Sirshana : When you are doing headstand you are forcing huge amount of enriched oxygenated blood to go upstream towards your brain, which when done repeatedly, makes nerves more strong, helps in rejuvinating your brain. 2. Pranayama : It literally means Pran(life force)+ayam(to control). Controlling your breathing is the first step towards making your mind come in control. I cannot explain you in two simple lines its a huge subject. I would suggest you to google about it, you can read tones of articles. Why I am suggesting both of this exercises before Vipassana is because Vipassana is a very advanced yogic technique. It deals with self realisation and understanding oneself. Just like you cannot see your reflection properly in a pond if there are ripples in there, same is in the case of your mind. You cannot find yourself if you're already disturbed. Every thought of that hot girl you met today, that missed trade opportunity you should've bet, that call to the closest friend, is going to create ripples in your mind.

"1. Oil based lube is better for fucking as it doesn't dry out. Crisco is OK, Silicon oil is good as well. If you insert your fingers, copious amounts of (warm) water-based lube are good as well2. start out with one finger, then work up to 4 (leaving out the thumb)3. use soft-vinyl surgical gloves (latex ones are OK if he 100% has no allergy against latex) and use them inside out (the rough surface is the outside).4. go super slow. Start off by massaging his asshole for a long time, then gently poke it with the tip of a finger and see how he reacts.5. Ideally blow him before so his is already aroused.6. If either is nervous, a glass of wine doesn't hurt, but not more.7. If you got at least two fingers in, you might graduate to a 2 - 2.5cm plug, but I'd recommend sticking with fingers for quite some time. He might tell you when he wants more.8. Do not just shove something (or fingers) in, put pressure on the asshole and hold it. If he likes it, he will either relax the sphicter or push against the toy to get it in deeper. Don't forget to use your other hand to wank his dick.9. Again, use lots of lube and be patient. If ever possible, communicate to get an idea how he feels and when to do more.10. Hitting the prostate is great, but getting the butthole massaged is a very nice feeling as well. The penetration feels great too, so don't despair if you aren't able to target the prostate - with enough focus on his dick and good communication, penetration alone is extremely nice for us guys.11.

"Generally, you seem to be consistently exaggerating the scope of the problems with these social programs, and ignoring the possibility that they've actually done something beneficial.Price controls have been used broadly in the US at all levels of government, without ushering in an era of communist nightmare.  They run the risk of creating shortages, but make goods accessible.  They shouldn't be used carelessly, but it's not some kind of alien concept to our economic system.You're also exaggerating the scope of the student loan problem quite a bit.  40% of people are not in a lifetime of debt - that is the number of people who are behind or are not making payments.  Some of them have defaulted, while others have deferred or are simply behind without having defaulted.  Furthermore, **seventy percent** of the people who are defaulting got their educations at for-profit universities - demonstrating that this problem is not a necessary outcome of the government regulation, rather the outcome of businesses being allowed to behave in misleading and unregulated ways.The problem, by and large, doesn't seem to be that the government is guaranteeing loans - it's that the government was guaranteeing loans to shady businesses that misrepresented the quality of their school.  Again, two sides of the same coin.https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/a-crisis-in-student-loans-how-changes-in-the-characteristics-of-borrowers-and-in-the-institutions-they-attended-contributed-to-rising-loan-defaults/So, yes - I agree, the program that fueled those loans was a mistake, and the government needs to be more selective of where the money is spent.  But universities that have more stringent selective processes and good reputations have not seen a significant growth in the rate of default.  Which to me means that it's possible for such a program to work, if it is designed correctly.  And I'm by no means convinced that the program as a whole has led to 'worse results,' even acknowledging it's significant flaws, because we have yet to quantify the value of the education that those individuals have received.I think you're missing my point when it comes to income inequality and resource distribution.  I'm not advocating for a totally even distribution of resources - merely an *even enough* distribution of resources.  Which means that everyone has access to basic rights, which I would take to include some level of healthcare and education.  The idea that anyone is advocating for a perfectly even distribution is a crazy strawman.  What I am suggesting is that an extreme level of income inequality is dangerous to society, and the free market has no structures in place to prevent this from happening.You also talk about the US' economic mobility as if it's a function of a free market - but we don't have a free market.  We have a heavily regulated market, and we provide trillions of dollars of social services to redistribute wealth in our society.  What do you think mobility would look like without free public education?  Can you genuinely tell me you think it would go up?You claim that mobility doesn't exist in places where the market is heavily restricted - do you have an example?  Because the US market is rather heavily restricted.  We have rather high taxes and a rather large central government, with expensive military and social programs and tons of regs, and then a layer of state and local governments as well.  I'm trying to find a middle ground, but it feels like you're saying that you find every once of these interventions to be harmful.  Which, if true, does seem ideological - it would be very hard, for me, to reinterpret all of history such that the free market is always the best solution, and government intervention is always harmful.  It doesn't seem like much of a concession for you to acknowledge that it's possible for a government intervention to actively improve the situation.",Anaximeneez,1487883529,t3_5vjhav,t1_de4gfcz,1,0,de4m2o1,AskTrumpSupporters,93,0.010752688172043013

"The data included in my scatter plot wasn't intended to be relevant I was using it as a generic example of what I was talking about just in case you were unfamiliar with those maps. Fig.1 on your map is quite misleading, if you had a map with say the Iranians and the Turks it would be clear that Greeks and Turks are far more similar than say Greeks and Northern Europeans. If the chart was extended to the whole world we'd also see that from a distance there appear to be 3 main clusters, Africans, Mongloids and Caucasians. So it makes sense to classify races this way. Zoom in and we get your more specific chart, so perhaps it makes sense to make some sub categorisations. I would not say it's completely arbitrary, as is the case with the EM spectrum. If you look at Fig.1 on your chart, I'd say the natural classification would be into three groups, the Ashkenazi Jews, Middle Easterners and Europeans. This classification would obviously be superior to one that lumped Europeans together with Ashkenazi Jews and say half of the Middle Easterners.  If this is a discussion about ethnicity I think we have to ignore culture altogether, I live in London and work with a ton Indians and Chinese, 3rd/4th generation, they are 100% Western in culture, but I don't think it makes them any more Saxon/Celt/Germanic. (It certainly does make them more British in my eyes). Ethnicity is pure biology, nothing to do with culture. As for phenotype I'd say from my time in Southern Italy that your average Iranian looks more white than your average Sicilian. The waters are very muddy here. I'm not arguing that it doesn't make sense to classify based on European culture, I'm saying that it doesn't make sense to classify a European peoples based on biology alone.",[deleted],1503329727,t3_6uxtbh,t1_dlxd9aj,3,0,dlxe63f,DebateAltRight,38,0.07894736842105263

"Straight up no one wants to ""purge"" Sanderites from the Democratic party. Our entire argument is that they are a small but crucial minority of the party and that we need them to reunify with their fellow Democrats and stop trying to hold vulnerable people hostage over their imaginary grievances. Sanderites are not our base. Women and people of color are our base. Our base *overwhelmingly* preferred Sec Clinton over Mr Sanders.  Again, literally no one is vilifying people just for voting for Mr Sanders in the primary. In fact, a lot of ESS regulars themselves voted for him in the primary. A good primary is healthy for the party and we all know that. What we are criticizing is the Sanderites who tried to destabilize the party and defame Sec Clinton over manufactured grievances and disinformation. We are critical of Mr Sanders because he is an egomaniac who was so desperate to win that he refused to concede for 3+ months after his elimination and radicalized a number of his supporters against the Democratic party, which caused us to lose in November.",AnitaSnarkeesian,1498700992,t3_6k09hb,t1_djj7nrj,19,0,djjf91e,EnoughTrumpSpam,100,0.19

"/u/Saint_Nitouche explained the plot well. To expand a little, it's essentially about the beauty and glory of everyday people. Joyce parallels the goings-on of a single day in Dublin with the events of Homer's Odyssey in order to elevate the mundanities of normal life to the level of myth. At the same time, he creates the deepest, most multilayered characters you'll ever find in literature, often by laying out all their thoughts on the page in a stream-of-consciousness prose style.There's also a whole thing of Joyce 'concluding' the novel as a literary form by creating a work which includes pretty much every style of writing you could think of.

"But in private systems if you're unhappy with your bloated and inefficient bureaucracy, YOU CAN CHOOSE NOT TO DEAL WITH THEM. When the government runs the show, if you don't tick the correct box there's nothing you can do about it, you're just fucked.  And that's that. The government says you die, so you die.And as the funding predictably fails, more and more exceptions will be made and more hoops will need to be navigated. [Now it's smokers and the obese.](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/22/nhs-letter-more-rations-on-operations-obese-smokers?CMP=twt_gu) Well no offense, but you clearly haven't even casually looked into the issue, then. People in the UK are sick of the NHS, and want to gain some control over their health status by having private options. Take a look at the comment section of that article and you'll see exactly what I mean. The only reason that healthcare is so expensive is because the government attempts to control so many aspects of it. In a world where were we don't artificially limit the number of doctors and actually have pricing information, people wouldn't need government assistance to go to the doctor in the first place. Once again this field mirrors higher education. When government dollars pour into the field, the price predictably rises dramatically. Then the government uses those high prices to ""prove"" that without their ""help"", nobody would be able to afford school.

"If you really want to know what gets between the Democratic Party's platform and voters, you need to look at the single-issue voters.For example, a lot of Catholics (but not all) are both socially conservative, but economically liberal. A lot of them would be open to a wide range of progressive ideas, but could never bring themselves to vote for a pro-choice candidate. That's it.Unfortunately, the same goes for guns. So long as Democrats are the party of gun control (which I support), then Democrats will lose rural voters who would only benefit from expanded education resources that Democrats offer in their platform. A lot of Republicans want better schools for their kids, even if they have a different definition of what that means than Democrats. If better schools mean expanded sex-ed programs, then you'll lose Republican support. I don't really have an answer for this at the national level, but I think at the local level it's possible to get conservative Democrats elected. The biggest risk is compromising so much that the Democratic platform warps under the strain of all the compromise and becomes a party that I can't recognize as liberal any longer.",Gettingbetter,1488212469,t3_5w6xnt,t1_de87gat,3,0,dea2zyn,PoliticalDiscussion,395,0.007594936708860759

Your title is equivalent to saying ""if we assume slavery never took place, then arguments against reparations are very logical."" You think it is unfair for people to cast pro-life arguments as foolish or offensive, but your defense is that they make perfect sense once we all agree they are correct. The point you are *actually* arguing is that a fetus has full legal and ethical personhood from the moment of conception, and even when the fetus is at the microscopic level, people outside the family with no knowledge of context should (a) attribute preferences, rights, and interests to the fetus based on guessing what the fetus might hypothetically want for itself if it was or had ever been capable of conscious thought, (b) weight those presumed preferences, rights, and interests as superior to the stated, knowable interests of the fully conscious mother in all respects, (c) require the mother to place the unstated, assumed preferences, rights, and interests of the fetus above her own, and (d) side with the unstated, assumed preferences, rights and interests of the fetus by default even when the mother's long-term health, well-being, and knowable, concious preferences regarding her fully-established human right to basic autonomy is violated. In other words, your argument is ""because personhood is difficult to define in early pregnancy, the most ethical option is to defacto ignore the personhood of the mother and prioritize what biased third-party outsiders *guess* to be the likely interest of a fetus that has no preferences and that will lose those same rights if or when the fetus becomes a concious person capable of conception itself.""Which is fine, and a case you are welcome to argue with others - but as phrased, your CMV simply assumes that the profoundly difficult part of the argument is true.",ChristopherMarlowe,1488808458,t3_5xr5cn,t3_5xr5cn,3,0,deknro8,changemyview,235,0.01276595744680851

These time ranges will overlap each other in several cases but events will still be in chronological order.There's a lot going on in this episode, so I'm afraid this is going to be a long one.**1st January 2015 - 8th January 2015:****On-screen day 1:**MusAni's production staff wish each other a happy new year, confirming that the new year has started. The president announces that MusAni will be producing Third Aerial Girls Squad this year. Watanabe promotes Aoi to production manager and Tarou to head production assistant. Later that day, Aoi reads the Third Aerial Girls Squad manga at home.As for other hints regarding the time: Watanabe says that he plans to bring someone with experience in February [Episode 14](/s ""(he's referring to Hiraoka)"") and two recruits in spring (April in another translation) [Episode 15](/s ""(he's referring to Andou and Satou)""). The estimated air date for the first episode of Third Aerial Girls Squad is the 1st October (Thursday). If this does not change, this means that the final episode will air on the 24th December.**On-screen day 2:**Aoi discusses the project with the director and they offer the character designer position to Ogasawara, but she declines and suggests Iguchi. Iguchi does accept after some convincing.**On-screen day 3:**Aoi and the director meet Atsumi in a café to offer him the art director position. He requests some time to think about it.On their way back to the office, Aoi mentions that she's going to contact Atsumi next week, but a lot more time actually passes until they meet him again.Aoi also talks about her new position with her sister via phone.**On-screen day 4:**Rii finds Aoi researching fighter jets in the library and offers her to do the research for her. Meanwhile, Zuka receives a script for the Third Aerial Girls Squad audition. It takes place on the 9th February.**9th January 2015 (Friday):**This date is shown on Aoi's desk phone for a split second as she hangs up after her call with Watanabe.

Sunrise in Tokyo on the 9th January 2015 would begin at 6:51, so this is probably not the same day.Ema, Ogasawara and Iguchi discuss Iguchi's character designs and Watanabe, the director, Maitake and Katusragi visit the Yotaka Bookshop main office to discuss the anime adaptation of Third Aerial Girls Squad.**On-screen day 2:**Aoi, the director and Maitake do field research.**On-screen day 3:**Aoi and the director receive character designs from Iguchi.**9th February 2015 (Monday):**Zuka arrives at R&amp;B studio for the Third Aerial Girls Squad audition.

"The cause of this symptom is men. If cultural aspects really played as big a role as you claim there would be cultures where women are the ones who overwhelmingly rape, kill, and start wars, but they don't exist. Cultural attitudes towards violence vary but men as a whole really don't. I'm really struggling to understand why you're so opposed to this kind of critical analysis when it comes to male violence.  You say that the only reason men are violent is because they hold societal power, but why do you think that is? How and why did they get the power in the first place? Did women just collectively decide to be less violent and let the men take over? Everyone might be susceptible to violence but I think you need to ask yourself why men commit the vast majorities of rape and murder across all cultures.

Poetry existed amongst the Quraysh and it was customary that anything you wanted to draw attention to amongst the subtribes you'd compose your poetry orally and say it in front of the kaaba. Very few Arabs could read or write as Arabic script was completely new at the time and the poetry which did exist existed orally and it was extremely basic for example compare the poem of lam by Abu Talib to the script of the Quran, even though Abu Talib was regarded as a fine poet by the Quraysh, it's extremely basic in composition in comparison to the Quran. Nothing like the Quran had ever been heard before by the Arabs and what the Arabs understood as poetry was completely surpassed by the Quran, so to say the Quran is poetry undermines it.

At the end of it, it was seen as *very* good. The goal isn't to teach how the world came into existence. Science books are to teach how. The Torah is to explain the existential questions.Another example: The Torah says humans are made b'tzelem Elokim. This isn't to explain our physical constitution whatsoever.

Abortion is literally a complete net positive for a society - like if this was a video game it would be a massive buff with no downsides. No one loses except for the non-existent fetus that first has no consciousness so it doesn't even know it's not being birthed and with that since no one has ever met them they are not affecting society in any way and thus if they do not exist how the fuck does that affect a society...? Be against it all you personally want since I don't give a fuck what you do with **your** fucking body - but I would prefer if you planned for a pregnancy since that literally is better for every single fucking person in society.The discussion is finished.

"They are different. Some have fleshy lips that can cause friction for both of you if they're not sufficiently wet. Some girls get sopping wet in moments, some take some time, some need some lube. The opening itself is pretty much in the same place across the board, but the location of the clit can vary and the structure of the vulva and vagina varies a lot.Yes, you need to get her good and wet, and a good way to learn your way around is to get your face down there and explore things. Using your fingers also lets you get some of her natural lube on the outside.To find the opening, what I will do sometimes is tease her by holding my dick in my hand and rubbing it up and down her slit. It helps to spread the lube on my head and you'll find the spot where it goes in without randomly poking. Just her moving her hips can change where you thought it was.

"What does negotiating or talking to the American people have to do with the fact that Congress will *not* enact bills of permanence that run contrary to their political agenda? No amount of negotiation or hand wringing is going to change that, it's not how the government has worked, *especially* the last 10 years or 15 years.  I haven't seen trump do great at negotiating so far, have you? He managed to anger Mexico rather than negotiate some type of system for them to pay for the wall, he didn't manage to negotiate a full repeal of Obamacare but rather some version of Obamacare lite, he hasn't proved at all that in a political climate he either has the ability, the sway, or the respect of world leaders or Congress to actually negotiate anything. People say this kind of stuff all the time about Trump. It's directly out of trumps own self congratulatory playbook where he calls himself an the best negotiator, the best salesman, the best businessman, the best this and the best that, but so far he hasn't *shown* any of this. He has hundreds, even thousands of unfilled government positions that don't require Senate confirmation, he has had an incredibly slow and uneventful first month in office with almost nothing concrete accomplished, while the past two presidents already had massive changes happened like tax plans, health care enacted and being installed, and the government positions being filled at more than a snails pace. Why are trumps supposedly fantastic management and negotiation skills seemingly not working in the white house environment? Why is he having so much trouble with internal leaks, why are so many positions unfilled?

So all joking aside, the conservatives, especially the ones who love Trump, manifested this guy too. He did the whole Hillary thing, where he acted like he belonged to the common man/woman. He probably learned it from her, they are/were friends.Trump is like the personification of American's greed and want to have it all.

If you think your dog would be wronged if he's taken away and killed, wouldn't you also have to admit that killing livestock is wrong as well?

"It depends on your personality and why you become socially isolated. If you're very extroverted and you're somehow forced to become socially isolated, then yes, it can negatively affect your health and you may become very depressed. But if you're introverted and the social isolation is a choice, you can be perfectly fine and it might actually improve your overall health because you'll most likely become less stressed. However, humans are social beings and we do need some kind of interaction with someone. But it can be a few friends, family members, coworkers, neighbors or even animals.

Tesla wants to sell their product directly to customers but are prevented from doing so because of state laws that both mandate their use of dealerships and regulate dealership service and repair.

"This is my first time ever attempting Beef Wellington. I got two a little over 4lbs tenderloins, that I butchered up into 2 2-2.5lbs loins and then tied them up and seasoned with salt and pepper then seared and rested.

Then instead of using pate I purred some chicken liver and used some organic duck fat I bought from the super market instead of butter. After cooking those together I let it cool down and then spread it over some prosciutto di parma that I had spread over some plastic wrap. I then put the seared tenderloin on top of this and similar to sushi making I used the plastic wrap under it to wrap it around the tenderloin. I was looking up some recipes and I ended up using a method I read in a recipe and used phyllo dough instead of a crepe. I used an egg wash to seal it up and then very carefully lift it up using the plastic wrap under it and flipped in into the puff pastry I bought from the store. The phyllo was pretty tough to work with, if I do it again, I'll probably go for the crepe just to see the difference. I molded the edges of the puff pastry together to make the 2 into 1 sheet. And then used to egg wash to seal up the seam. I wrapped it up and tore off the excess dough. I started the cooking at 450 then dropped to 425 after 20 mins or so, then to 400 to finish it off. I did make it bleed when i poked it with a therm, but that just me being dumb. I personally would have wanted it more rare, but my father, who was the person who really wanted the dish in the first place, doesn't like his as rare as me. But, it's tenderloin, it's still good. I made twice baked potatoes, asparagus with bur blanc sauce, and cauliflower in a cheddar sauce (basically bechamal with cheddar).",Peter_of_RS,1482776479,t3_5keysn,t3_5keysn,1,0,dbnf10s,food,1,1.0

(2) Simply sitting on the outside doesn't make a person an outsider--they actually have to take a position critical of the insiders and advocate policies opposed to insider interests. Somebody who is so preoccupied with becoming an insider that he's willing to become the POTUS so that he can force himself into their inner circle is obviously not an outsider.But this kind of thinking is completely impenetrable.

I really admire that. To see her career end like this to me is just kind of anti-climactic to me. Her qualifications were unparalleled. She wanted to run this country for everybody no matter who you supported, who you love, what color your skin is, how you pray, etc. This made me feel so hopeful about the future of the country.  Now this is all gone to me. So much progress seems to me like it will just vanish within the first few days of the next administration. Her opponent ran his campaign entirely on divisiveness and it won and now we are all grieving and terrified of what my come next, I know I am.

Reasonable enough, since we don't have much other maths that handles superposition:&gt;humor psychologists believe that humor often involves not just shifting from one interpretation of an ambiguous stimulus to another, but simultaneously holding in mind the interpretation that was perceived to be relevant during the set-up and the interpretation that is perceived to be relevant during the punchline. For this reason, we turned to the generalized quantum formalism as a possible approach for modeling the cognitive state of holding two schemas in mind simultaneously.",Bowgentle,1489924692,t3_603fyd,t1_df420r7,3,0,df4kru3,science,12,0.25

"I didn't think it could happen, but I hit a new peak! Listening to that Susan Cox interview that was posted yesterday sent me into a huge tailspin about Queer theory. I didn't study humanities at all in college so I had no idea what this really is about. Honestly I thought it was just an inclusive word for non-vanilla sex people. Gay? Lesbian? Let's just say Queer! BDSM? Sure, you can be queer too! It was annoying but it didn't seem like a problem beyond semantics. I am heterosexual so I didn't feel like it was my place to point out how stupid it was, but whatever.

You have to take an instrument and demonstrate its ability to do things nobody even knew it could do. You have to write chord progressions and melodies that don't sound familiar, or even change the very design and function of an instrument.

Note, however, that most shoes can be ""upgraded"" to be more stability-enhancing by purchasing stability insoles like Superfeet (etc). The general rule of thumb is that, in the absence of any reason to go stronger, go with the weakest model which is probably way more stability than the default insole that comes with any shoe. At the risk of sounding like a paid shill, the reason Superfeet are nice is that, even though they cost an arm and a leg, they have a very generous return policy (even after you've cut and used them) so if your first set doesn't work out, you can swap them for something else.",user26983-8469389655,1485976024,t3_5rg4l3,t3_5rg4l3,1,0,dd78lhe,Fitness,13,0.07692307692307693

"Again, her friend's account is no more valuable than the officer's account.  If the officer has reason to lie, so, too, does the friend.  I also reiterate that I see nothing to suggest the friend was a direct witness.It's a pet peeve of mine when people say ""But what about tasers/pepper spray??"".  It's clear that the person saying this has never used either.  They are not magical ""off' buttons for suspects.  I have seen suspects keep right on moving through both.  I would say that in the experience of the numerous officers I have spoken to, they are only effective about 20% of the time.  When a suspect has a knife is not the time to gamble.Assuming both/either would have been effective, lets look at what ""effective"" looks like in this case; OC pepperspray is an aeresolized irritant.  In the confines of the apartment, they would have sprayed both her, her partner and every officer in the room.

The officer was also treated for knife wounds.

In the Old Testament the fig tree is sometimes almost a symbol for 'home' or for prosperity (e.g. 1 Ki. 4:25; Is. 36:16; Zc. 3:10); occasionally in rabbinic literature its shade is associated with a place for meditation and prayer (SB 2. 371). But John's chief point here is Jesus' supernatural knowledge (cf. 2:4; 4:17-18; 6:70; 9:3; 11:4, 11: 13:10-11, 38), not Nathanael's activity.",[deleted],1501594033,t3_6quisw,t3_6quisw,2,0,dl0eeql,Christianity,9,0.2222222222222222

"The worst thing you did was assume that something was pointless, and it seems like you may have explained your position a little too forwardly. If you don't understand the significance of something, the correct response should be to ask questions, or say that you don't understand it, not to express that the action seems pointless. It also kind sounds like you mansplained feminism to them, which (even if you're right) is going to be met with backlash. When you're telling your side of the story, you're likely omitting how they perceived you. If someone asked me what I think equality is, and then told me I was a bad feminist/didn't understand feminism, I would be pissed off.If you want to keep those friends, I would offer an apology framed as: ""I'm sorry for my part in our recent disagreement, I should have asked questions rather than pushing my perspective, I value your friendship so I'd like to make things right between us."" If their response is continued hostility, or lacking an apology for their part in the argument (particularly what they called you), I would probably consider distancing yourselves from those people.

"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Necklacing&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1Necklacing ""sentences"" were sometimes handed down against alleged criminals by ""people's courts"" established in black townships as a means of enforcing their own judicial system. Necklacing was also used by the black community to punish its members who were perceived as collaborators with the apartheid government. These included black policemen, town councilors and others, as well as their relatives and associates. The practice was often carried out in the name of the African National Congress, although the ANC executive body condemned it.[4][5] In 1986 Winnie Mandela, then-wife of the imprisoned Nelson Mandela, stated ""With our boxes of matches and our necklaces we shall liberate this country"" which was widely seen as an implicit endorsement of necklacing,[6] which at the time caused the ANC to distance itself from her,[7] although she later took on a number of official positions within the party.[7]",sreggin_llik,1436681056,t3_3cxw1d,t3_3cxw1d,2,0,ct0g34z,CoonTown,1,2.0

"You're not an asshole but... Your timing may be inappropriate. Mediums do parlor tricks but people who seek out mediums are desperately searching for someone who will tell them everything is okay. And some people are willing to swallow the bullshit to ease that feeling of desperation and loss that they may have. When my sister lost her friend she went to see a medium, of course I knew it was all smoke and mirrors but she desperately needed to have someone help cope with the pain of loss. So I just smiled and nodded and was there for her, and the medium helped her move past it. If I told her now about what a cold read is and how mediums use tricks to give the appearance that they speak to the supernatural she would probably see it my way. But fact is if I did it immediately after seeing the medium it would have just undone any emotional healing that may have occurred. Some people need to hold on to that hope. Not everyone is strong enough to accept that their love ones have ceased to exist. By exposing what they participated in as a scam you effectively undone everything that made him or her feel a little better plus they're  out however much he or she paid for the medium and now has to cope with the fact that he or she had been scammed and probably feel really stupid on top of grieving and of course you come off as an ass for taking away their hope.

"Again, the Clintons and the DNC could force the media to give Trump $5.6B in free media, but they couldn't convince them to stop giving her overwhelmingly negative coverage. It doesn't make sense. The email you're referring to doesn't show what you think it does. It shows a strategy that they employed to pull the entire Republican field to the right along with Trump and the nuts. It specifically mentions that the strategy was designed to have the same effect that the 2012 primary had on Romney - namely that it forced him to move right to win the primary and hurt him in the general election because he couldn't get back to the middle effectively. They were targeting the Romneys of the race (Bush, Rubio, Walker, Paul, Jindal and Christie) with the assumption that one of them would be the candidate.It doesn't show them begging the media to cover every Trump speech live for free. The media didn't do that because the Clintons asked them to. They did it because it was best for ratings. Just like Clinton scandals were best for ratings.

"Bisexual older (over 40) guy here: **Straight Porn** - my porn tastes have not really changed, just been adjusted. I still like lesbian, MILF and big boobs.  Only, the lesbians now either amateur, BDSM, interracial or a combo of all three. MILFs obviously had to get older and we luckily live in an age of some damn fucking hot 50 and even 60 year olds. Big boobs morphed into bigger women because that's where you find all the best *NATURAL* big boobs.  In fact, I no longer find skinny women that attractive - they look like cross-dressing 16 year boys to me. Plus, in my own experience, plus-size women have made the best lovers. Almost all the ones I play with are bi as well which made accepting my own bisexuality easier. **Gay/Bi Porn** - my changing tastes here have pretty much tracked my developing sexuality. In fact, I think porn has really expanded my sexual horizons and influenced it a bit.  Especially in the beginning. When I was a teen (13-16), I had fooled around with neighborhood buddies, swapping oral. Then I learned how to suck my own dick so I didn't need to seek it out. But what returned me to guy-guy sex IRL in my early 20s was discovering what used to be called ""She-male"" porn. Seeing totally passable, hot chicks with tits &amp; dicks really flipped a switch in me. It's a pretty straight line from seeing guys blowing trans women to bi porn to eventually gay porn that mirrored/influenced what I did IRL. I hooked up with trans woman, then the whole 900 ""sex lines"" hook up thing came along (you could leave messages or get them for like $2 a minute. The one we had here was called ""The Confidential Connection"") so I could find other bi-curious guys who *only* wanted to swap oral (no anal, no kissing) and then finally just admitting that I like (big) cock along with pussy.",happyhedonist,1484498103,t3_5o46r9,t3_5o46r9,2,0,dcgkdd0,sex,28,0.07142857142857142

"If you have a wife now or in the future, and she has no genetic abnormalities that concern you, you might also consider just using a sperm donor instead, it is cheaper and still gives you 9 months to fully prepare for the baby and be there for the birth which makes bonding easier. Adoption can be more expensive and you don't know for sure how healthy the mother was during the pregnancy, I mean adoption works out for many people, but I just wanted to give you other options to think about.I don't have autism, but I found out while trying to have kids that I have an unfortunate condition called azoospermia, where basically I have no sperm so was not able to have children of my own.

"Not sure what point you're trying to make here, maybe I can't throw a knife through a wall, but I can drive a car through it, or break through it with a sledge hammer, or cut through it with a chainsaw. Regardless of the tool I use, the decision, the action, and the responsibility for whatever happens as a result is solely on me, and changing the tool will not change that. Again, that depends on the people, not the number of guns. If all those people complied with the restrictions against murder and assault, it wouldn't matter if they all carried 100 guns at all times. If one person chooses to misuse their guns, the fault would lie solely with that person, and those who remain in compliance with the law pose no additional threat.  No, I am not; I have stated clearly that guns are dangerous tools that must be used properly. More importantly, I have pointed out that, regardless of whether a gun is used properly, the user is responsible for whatever happens as a result of that use. Considering what might happen if you miss your target in a defense situation is something every (law-abiding) user must do, as we can be held accountable for any damage that results.  No, I choose individual liberty, personal responsibility, and the rule of law over ineffective blanket prohibitions; I have never made any reference to race. I don't care what your skin color is; if you're obeying the law, I have no issue with you owning a gun, but I expect the same in return. If you are breaking the law, you and you alone should face the consequences, and there is no justification for denying everyone else's rights because of your actions. Besides, gun control was developed as a means to keep ""people of color in inner cities"" from possessing the means to defend themselves.http://www.mtv.com/news/2900230/the-really-really-racist-history-of-gun-control-in-america/ No it isn't; it is a fundamental guarantee established by the governing document of this country. And unless you have the support of the US Congress and 2/3s of the state legislatures (hint: you don't), it isn't going anywhere. Yelling fire in a crowded theatre creates a clear and present danger to the general public; so long as you are in compliance with all other laws, owning a gun (or any other potentially dangerous tool) does not. Because membership within militia is not a prerequisite for owning a firearm, nor has it ever been. The right is specifically granted to ""the People"", which includes those who would not otherwise qualify for militia membership (females, the infirm, or the elderly).

"So in philosophy the [moral status of animals](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-animal/) (which is what will give us standing to in the rightness or wrongness of, say, consuming an animal) is attributed to a few things. That SEP article says: Most of those refer to capabilities or properties of cognition and/or thought, or said another way: *intelligence*. Indeed all of those aren't necessarily required or even unique to humans, but the literature comes back to those things quite often. I'd take that as an indicator of what the experts on morality (philosophy and ethics professionals) tend to think/consider.Your reasoning for not eating dumb people or that people associate dogs with pets I think is psychologically interesting as an *explanation* of why people don't do those things but doesn't necessarily speak to the moral considerations which is what actually says we should or shouldn't (in a normative way) eat animals or people.**edit:** in other words: that might explain why people don't eat a dog, but not why we *shouldn't* eat a dog",FliedenRailway,1495085487,t3_6bqwlj,t1_dhott9x,3,0,dhpl1ak,changemyview,67,0.04477611940298507

"Diane Duane did new editions of her ""So you want to be a wizard?"" series. She started it in the 80s and it was starting to get a little dated. She updated the first 8 or 9 books in the series with book 1 now taking place in 2008 (instead of 30 years before). Some of this took out some inconsistencies, scenes were added (which I think some were worked out for a movie that never happened). *Plus* it was updated, they had MacBook Air computers instead of Apple II computers (iPods instead Walkman), cell phones were made to exist in the older stories and so on.  Definitely an exception I think. These might even only still be available at her ebook store, but DRM free and way cheaper than they'd ever be at Amazon. Eventually these will make it into the printed copies I hope.But as a kid I recall newer versions of the Hardy Boys books were slightly updated (they weren't marketed as new editions, but it seems to me were were some minor differences that I noticed).

Read post, check account activity, call out troll, move along.In any event - that Clinton and her PACs were aware of and actively tried to control Social Media isn't a question.[Here's a report](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3038621/More-2-MILLION-Hillary-Clinton-s-Twitter-followers-fake-never-tweet.html) on 2 Million fake or inactive Clinton Twitter followers, in addition to doing similar on Facebook.[Here's a report](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/05/17/the-very-intense-man-probing-the-president) on Clinton's campaign use of FEC loopholes to coordinate with [Correct the Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correct_the_Record) to actively “push back against"" users on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Instagram. Clinton PAC, *Correct the Record/Barrier Breakers* even released a statement; Speaking of [Correct the Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correct_the_Record#Purpose); *""About a dozen people""*? How many posts can you *produce* in an hour when paid to do so? 1 every 10min seems generous, especially with [Copy I'm also assuming those were *full-time, in-house* employees with who an Organization's President would be familiar, and not the *freelancer* types employed by third parties, like the one below.And then [here's an archived thread] (https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3rncq9/confession_of_hillary_shill_from/) purportedly from a former Hillary *shill*. I qualify it with *""purportedly""*, but imo there's more than enough supporting detail, info, links, and updates to support OP's position.So while it's difficult, and purposefully so, to determine with total accuracy the number of *shill* accounts (paid or volunteer), there's no question that it happened, and that there were active measures taken by probably all political parties, but most blatantly by the well-oiled and funded Clinton Machine, to control her narrative and public image through heavy-handed control of Social Media.",dparks2010,1495115735,t3_6btfp2,t1_dhpf90b,1,0,dhpyt40,AskThe_Donald,74,0.013513513513513514

"Unfortunately,  ""lust"" is understood today in a way that is different from the meaning in Jesus' time.    When Jesus said that anyone who looks at a woman with lust is guilty of adultery with her, he was not speaking of sexual thoughts exclusively.     The greek word used in the New Testament texts parallels the concept of coveting,  as in the commandment in the law of Moses not to covet *anything* which does not belong to you but instead belongs to someone else.   Jesus was reiterating the commandment, not condemning sexual thought and fantasy. So there's an easy way to know if you're lusting after a thing or not:   Do you want that which belongs to someone else?   If your best friend has a girlfriend and you want her to be with you instead, yes, that's lust.  Lust isn't exclusively about sex or exclusively sexual.  While /u/oh_no_mrbill has given a passionate and highly popular answer, what he is describing is greed  and/or gluttony, not lust as it was understood in 1st Century Judean culture.Tl;dr - Lust wants to take something from someone else and have it for yourself.",RazorINC,1501659441,t3_6r1xdw,t3_6r1xdw,4,0,dl1upzt,Christianity,17,0.2352941176470588

"First of all LSD is an old drug. It took a very large amount of research, testing and development to create that drug initially. Yes they could make it now because the synthesis is public, but if that drug was patentable, the patent would last for 20 years. Approximately 5-15 of those years would be used on  testing and clinical trials. Tens of thousands of drugs for the same purpose are patented then narrowed down over those years with millions upon millions of dollars being swallowed in the process. Finally you have a drug that has passed clinical trials and can be marketed. You have about another 5-15 years to sell that drug for a premium to make up the losses of research and development, then the patent runs out and generics are sold for pennies on the dollar. Along with this the regulations in the US mandate that you have to know the exact detail of every batch and pill/dose that is made for these drugs. They are tracked from raw materials, to the desk of the pharmacy causing a huge logistical nightmare for the company selling the drug. If Universities could profit off of drug design they would, but in reality the  total process has massive overhead and the regulatory horrors that Universities would have to face is unrealistic. Just as a statistic to show the massive difference The Ohio State University, one of the largest state Universities, operated with a 500 million dollar profit for the 2016-2017 school year [Ohio State Stat](https://www.osu.edu/osutoday/stuinfo.php). Proctor and Gamble operated at a 10.5 billion dollar net earnings that are actually attributed to the sales of the company [Proctor an Gamble Stat](http://www.pginvestor.com/Cache/1500090608.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1500090608&amp;iid=4004124). Making known drugs is often quite easy at an undergraduate and graduate level, but research and development requires the very best in economic, scientific, and logistic minds. I think you underestimate the amount of money it takes to create new drugs.Edit: Grammatical and lazy errorsEdit 2: Here's more on the research and development phase. There is a graphic showing an even more bleak outlook on profitability time margins in the production of drugs.[More on Research and Development](http://www.phap.org.ph/index.php?cid=3)",TheRealGuyTheToolGuy,1495431941,t3_6ccukh,t1_dhvj5s3,1,0,dhvjxcv,changemyview,70,0.014285714285714284

"At the moment, it's been retweeted 53k times. Wyden started with a following of 59k. Trump seems to get between 10k and 30k retweets, though he tweets up a storm and has 19,600k followers.What I like about Twitter is that it encourages people to move from topic to topic, a process that could enable cautious individuals to expand their perspectives and increase their understanding of the world.What I don't like about Twitter is that it doesn't allow conversations to flow or be seen easily, as do forum based solutions. Further, it's atrocious when it comes to sourcing information and prevents anyone from going into depth. Politics is not a topic suited to 140 characters, particularly not if they're all in caps and half of them are hashtags.Something I feel works best about Reddit itself is that we're not only nameless but also *faceless* (and relatively emoji-less). Twitter, Facebook, and 4chan all give us visual cues that inevitably interrupt our better instincts to excuse our bad manners. All of those stereotypes we have for the dumbies in our world are amplified as we ignore anyone who looks like a kid or represents themselves with memes, trucks, beer, snapchat filters, duck face, celebrities, or ancient jokes copied down from facebook posts.Also notable is the branching format of discussion here which, while imperfect, allows a much broader and organized sifting of content. It takes minimal effort to find a new starting point for the same conversation. Comparably, Twitter acts like a rabbit hole that you have to dig through in a random, blind line.

The issue with law is that it sets a precedent to be used elsewhere. Legal cases &amp; legal standards are never *exclusively* about a single case. Your distinction about it being a product is arbitrary from the perspective of a legal argument.  It won't stop other lawyers from citing the precedent &amp; as a result it is irrelevant.  If the court ruled that a baker can enforce discriminatory practices on the grounds that he feels like he is part of the event (even though he clearly was not invited) then anybody can make the same claim.  The innkeeper feels like they are part of the experience and therefore gays cannot sleep there.  The private schoolteacher (who has more reason to feel like they are part of the experience) doesn't need to teach a subset of students.

"I'm not talking about ""climate engineering"" in the way I think you are, more just processes that remove pollutants from the atmosphere. Denmark recently unveiled a atmospheric vacuum that is designed to pull co2 out of the air, things of this nature help to reverse man made damage to let nature run its course.  Exactly, we have a responsibility to ensure people alive now can lead lives that enable them to create better lives for their families today, not for families in another country in 100 years. Especially since just at free market pace we will be in a green energy planet in the next 10-15 years. Technology will solve the climate problem, we just have to let it, and we can't punish poor people alive today just because they are poor. It's not legally binding, meaning countries like the United States would end up enacting green policies, and china and India (the real polluters) wouldn't, so the net change would be awful for the United States and the planet. Not to mention the economic destruction it would have enacted on the United States. It would have increased energy prices for average American families by between 13-20% annually, forcing a loss of annual income by $20,000 by 2035. That's crazy. It would always have decreased the GDP  of the us by over $2.5T by 2035, decimating things like social security, all according to [this heritage foundation study](www.heritage.org/environment/report/consequences-paris-protocol-devastating-economic-costs-essentially-zero).

"See I think this is where we disagree. It's easy to draw a line with words, following up on it is an entirely different story, just ask Obama. What is Trump realistically going to do when Kim inevitably tests another bomb and China inevitably defends them? Judging by his fire and fury comments anything short of a massive use of disproportionate force against Pyongyang would not be living up to the line he drew. And even in that scenario it's entirely plausible that Seoul gets leveled too. The reason nothing has been done about NK is decades is quite frankly because the options other than the status quo are so awful. I just don't see how Trump menacing and posturing does anybody any good in this situation and there's probably a reason previous president's haven't gotten into the same back and forth with Kim that Trump has. I don't see how this ends any different than Obama's red line against chemical weapons in Syria. It would require getting public support for a war with NK and probably a proxy war with China. Thr American public just doesn't have an appetite for that kind of thing, and especially NNs who tend to be less interventionist in my experience than the voting public as a whole.

We already do steer women towars careers. We steer them in the goal of equal representation in all fields regardless of what they actually want. Seems to me the system you want to avoid is already happening and a good way to show that we don't need to be doing this is to look for data on what women do want to do. Because they might already be doing it. So maybe we can stop pushing them into stem and start letting them do what they want.Total agreement that there is a danger they would be put in boxes of some fields are very far from what most women want. We need to treat people as individuals and this data could have negetive impact on divergent women. Making them feel like they shouldn't do what they want.So risks both ways in my opinion. Hard to get everyone to just let people do what they want.,timmytissue,1502412500,t3_6sx1db,t1_dlganos,1,0,dlgc310,changemyview,57,0.017543859649122806

It's the only way to gain that much weight in 2 weeks I think.I weigh my self about 2 times a day and I've noticed how my weight fluctuates. My normal weight is about 163, but it swings up and down by 3 pounds. If I carb up or consume heavy sodium for 2 days without exercising, my weight goes to 166. I weigh myself at 166 lb and go for a 1- 1.5 hour bike ride and when I weigh my self about 2 hours later, I weigh around 162 lb. I think glycogen is bound to water at a ratio of 1:2, someone correct me if I'm wrong.

"Part of the issue for me is Trump's inconsistency in almost everything. He bashed Obama for a poor economy and called the unemployment numbers lies yet as soon as he assumes office he cites those exact same numbers as proof that he is improving the economy (he hasn't really had a chance to even impact the economy yet). He campaigned on his ability to mend the relationships with Russia and mentioned something along the lines of, ""Of course Russia prefers me, Hillary is a warhawk, she's been bad for Russia, bad for America"" and then completely flip flops and says Russia wanted Clinton to win. I really really don't think this is a fair assessment of why people do not like Trump. I don't think he handles himself well, and I would prefer a president that is well spoken and has a modicum of class, but the reason I've been trending away from even being neutral about Trump is how he has been performing as a president. He has a super majority in Congress. He has failed to ever specify a single aspect of policy about how he would improve the ACA. He campaigned on improving our national healthcare system yet he never mentions how. He blames Congress for not repealing and replacing yet he blames the former president for putting the ACA into place. All in all, he just doesn't have any accountability for his actions.

"As other commenters have already said, it's because the whole ""TERF"" thing is a sexist witch hunt that relies mainly on insulting women for their bodies, appearance, or saying women are ""jealous"" of transwomen or whatever. When it comes to actual violence against trans people, men are almost 100% of the perpetrators, yet they spend the majority of their time attacking women they disagree with. Same with the ""SWERF"" thing. Men commit almost 100% of the violence, discrimination, silencing, and dehumanization of sex workers, but people spend most their effort attacking the WOMEN (many of whom are former sex workers) who vocally criticize the sex industry.Another factor is that men are much better at standing up for themselves and taking no shit. If transactivists tried the same absurd bullshit against men, men would tell them to fuck off or say ""is this a joke?"" Women are unfortunately socialized to put everyone else's needs before their own and let people trample all over them. I just don't think men would tolerate the bullshit and abuse.

"This is mainly a recent thing, which I believe is caused by the advancement of secularism in society, and religion appearing counterculture. I know traditional Catholic families where the children were raised in very religious surroundings, and as a result became strongly dedicated to it when they grew up. I was raised with a Catholic background, but my family stopped attending Mass regularly when I was about 8. I was always quite religious, but at 16 (about a year ago) I got really involved in the church by myself, but a lot of people my age with similar ""cultural Catholic"" upbringings just largely stopped caring about religion.So I certainly think it's all or nothing these days – if you want to raise your children with Christian values, you have to be serious and active about it. There is a greater risk of them blending secular values with Christian ones, and becoming too entrenched in the trappings of a non-Christian world.",Slenderauss,1479713441,t3_5e26v4,t1_da973j0,1,0,da99v9d,Christianity,10,0.1

"http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htmOfficial Unemployment is the U3 figure.  It measure's the number of people without jobs **that have actively looked for work in the last 4 weeks**Each figure after U3 adds another group of people on top of the previous group. U4 is everyone in the official figure plus folks who are no longer looking for work because they believe there are no jobs for them, usually because of a poor economy.U5 is the the U4 figure plus ""marginally attached workers""  folks who don't have a job, want a job, and have looked for one in the last **12 months**U6 is the U5 figure, plus folks who have part time or seasonal jobs, but want a full time job.  This final figure is often referred to as the *underemployment* rate.  People who's labor is being underutilized.Looking at these figures we can see that the U5 rate remains high, around 6 percent, and that the U6 figure has been around 9 percent.  What this reflects is the decline in what's called the labor participation rate.  The number of folks of an employable age who are either employed or actively looking for work.http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000As we can see, this rate has been declining steadily for the last decade.  This can in large part be chalked up to demographics.  As baby boomers age, they retire, and exit the labor force.  However, the decline accelerates around 2009, 2010.All in all, the U3 unemployment statistic is useful and valid, but is a far cry for the total picture of what's happening in the labor market.",alienvalentine,1478897079,t3_5cerjc,t1_d9w8plh,6,0,d9wbol2,Conservative,106,0.05660377358490566

"To my mind, the request for a citation is perfunctory and less helpful than simply revising to: ""*both parties* have been trying to do this for decades"". The clearest historical example of this [was done by FDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Procedures_Reform_Bill_of_1937). The ideal (of course) is political neutrality, but the partisan nature of the SCOTUS should be abundantly apparent to anyone who's been paying attention over the past few decades. It's often is coded as ""legislation from the bench"" or ""judicial activism"" and isn't strictly applied to the supreme court. For those that are new to this sort of thing, 1 minute of Googling produced the following from a conservative publication:* http://www.weeklystandard.com/next-justices/article/1024728Then there's the most recent GOP-lead tactic whereby Obama's nomination is being scuttled in congress. It's certainly possible they're doing that because they truly believe his pick is unqualified or unfit to sit on the bench. But, it's also (probably more) likely that the GOP sees an opportunity to replace the pick with someone they view as more inline with conservative ideals. The implication is clear: the supreme court is seen as a political tool and is currently being gamed by the GOP.* https://www.yahoo.com/news/republicans-vow-to-block-obama-supreme-court-011758577.html* https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/04/mccain-republicans-must-stop-supreme-court-from-tilting-to-the-left/* http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/cruz-supreme-court-blockade-230363* http://www.npr.org/2016/11/03/500560120/senate-republicans-could-block-potential-clinton-supreme-court-nominees",veringer,1481834828,t3_5ienpx,t1_db8b0uh,17,0,db8q24r,NeutralPolitics,554,0.030685920577617324

"It's not really so much prophetic as observational, as this is hardly the first time in history that sensationalized journalism had taken the stage, and Matheson is speaking here of its tendency to appear in the wake of crisis.I also think there's a distinction between yellow journalism and today's 'fake news' epidemic that's very important, and it's a matter of intent. Traditional yellow journalism was designed to drive up circulation by appealing to readers' morbid curiosities. It was tabloid dressed up as journalism.Today, what we're observing isn't purely to drive sales, but to win and ideological war between political philosophies, and partisanship is playing a much larger role than simple the one-upsmanship that got yellow journalism its name. Certainly, many of the same techniques of sensationalism are on display, and there's a yellow element to it, with mudslinging and accusations of scandal, but misreporting of what should be concrete fact is a different animal altogether. In addition, no crisis sparked this. We have no vampires threatening us, just a number of elections worldwide that have gone very differently than many of us might have expected or preferred.",VillainousInc,1493155489,t3_67jiez,t3_67jiez,5,0,dgqwcdj,books,2,2.5

"Another good episode! I feel that the plot is bout to kick into full gear within the next few episodes. The other day we had surfing elephants, and now we have little girls drowning cats....This show sure has gotten darker.#Characters**Nanami** - We learn that Nanami's unnatural love for her brother isn't as comedic as the show's been letting on - she seriously has some issues. She takes obsession and turns it up a notch. She believes that she is the only one who has a right to him and any person (or animal) that gets in between them deserves to die. She's quite literally a yandere. She ends up being the ""mysterious"" Duelist (that the OP *totally* didn't spoil). Her dueling outfit was freaking lit btw.**Touga** - As we saw in yesterday's episode, Touga is not only two-faced, but he's extremely manipulative. The episode start off with him promising to help fight Saionji's expulsion, yet we know that he is the one who orchestrated it. Saionji, who still believes that Touga is a good friend of his, gives him his beloved exchange diary, only for Touga to burn it the moment Saionji leaves the school. This leads me to believe that he's fabricating his relationship with his sister and is definitely manipulating her to do as he wants. He claims to have gathered all the data, so I'm guessing that he's been gathering information that'll guarantee his victory.**Himemiya** - She's smarter than she's letting on and she's definitely doing some string pulling of her own. I first noticed it when she provoked Juri by trying to give her the same rose that represented the girl she loved. This episode, she gifted Touga a cat, which just happened to have a serious meaning due to the siblings backstory. Her actions seem innocent enough, but she always triggers someone into wanting a duel - it's happened every time.

"###Bara wa, bara wa~~~~ ✨��    **Notes from a rewatcher**  Again playing catch up, so sorry!! Spent most of my Fourth of July yesterday calming down my sick mother after she was targetted by a cop yesterday morning, which made me think about this series quite a bit. That parallels can be drawn from my experiences today as a WoC in America to some of the encounters in Berubara gives me an idea of what Ikeda was feeling when she first wrote it as a story about the ""inner revolutions of Japanese women"". The themes studied here are, unfortunately, perpetual, and I think that speaks to why it's so effective. Borders are redrawn and democracies sprout where kingdoms lay, but back in the ranchos of Venezuela where some of my family escaped from, there were Rosalies everywhere and there still are, victims of 'magnanimous' rulers and ideological institutions that keep them considering ""what if I just sold my body so I can eat some bread?"" It's unsurprising to see Ikeda create someone like Oscar here, someone born in prestige who becomes a witness to the barbarism of a social hierarchy, when she herself was born and raised in Osaka within minutes of the Kamagasaki slums, where human rights riots roared throughout the 1960s and where shanty towns and soaplands are still active today. If there's any question for how a relic of the 70s (that was already based on events two hundred years before it) could somehow remain relevant now, I think it's in just how alarmingly relevant the ideas of it are and will somehow always be. (Sorry if this intro came on a bit strong today haha)    ---    **Comparisons with the manga** *(Chapters 3,7-10)*:     These episodes follow up on the Rosalie storyline by playing a bit of catch up with a few changes here and there to line it up. As mentioned before, Jeanne had previously [announced her departure from home](http://i.imgur.com/7DbdOCT.png), whereas Rosalie discovered her newfound nobility now months after, [thanks to a fated glimpse at her carraige](http://i.imgur.com/brfBN8p.png). In terms of what these changes do for Rosalie and Jeanne's interactions, there are surprisingly few differences from the source. Some changes are pretty interesting in terms of presentation (the flogging of Rosalie was more [graphic and desperate](http://imgur.com/a/vqKKa) in the manga, while more [surreal and brutal](http://i.imgur.com/039YVP5.png) in the anime), but the most interesting changes are in the timing, as Rosalie's segments were intercut into multiple chapters which allowed her to comment on some of the changes in the main plot, for example, she regularly tells us that she ""thought things would get better"" following the coronation of the royal couple earlier in the manga, whereas in the show the new couple had not yet been crowned.    The anime did, however, add a few new scenes that I think help the flow of some of these stories. Fersen, originally approached by Oscar immediately after the King had passed, left before he could tamper with her role as queen and [before he could cause her problems](http://i.imgur.com/OBiTaBe.png). While he is still clever enough to [figure it out](http://i.imgur.com/PYv1Tsv.png) in the series, by having him stay around a bit longer to show Antoinette's capriciousness, we're allowed to meet the bastard Duke de Guemene under a [political dense atmosphere](http://i.imgur.com/SPfT71M.png). Antoinette's handwaving of the nobles was an original idea that, in many ways, fits her character arc well, and this encounter with the Duke establishes just how far removed the nobility are from the impoverished in a way that allows the tragic encounter to happen. Again, its one of those situations where it's a change that only brings out ideas already in the manga but gives them a bit of shape, which is, imo, still the best way of going about an adaptation. Lining it up this way gave us an [excellent character-defining moment for Oscar](http://i.imgur.com/jM8mgcd.png), which I'm thankful for, even if I'm still a bit miffed about Rosalie's storyline being so condensed.     One final note, it appears that Lililicious is going to include some [Berubara Kids](http://i.imgur.com/f3zE2rT.jpg) snippets in this release, so if I see any of those (MAL entry [here](https://myanimelist.net/manga/18791/Berubara_Kids)), I'll be sure to include them!

"I know, right?  The part about WIC, the lengths to which COINTELPRO went, and why, and poor Fred . . . they did him so wrong.

She shouts to some fellow Panthers, ""They killed Fred!"" When I was in college, I spent a semester in Chicago as part of the Urban Studies program.  We'd have seminars where we'd travel to different parts of the city and engage with different social and political aspects of Chicago life, history, and politics.  I didn't really pay attention to the next one on the list, just that it was someone's apartment, and we were going to hear a woman named Akua Njeri, who used to be in the Panthers, speak.  We entered and there sat a beautiful deep-brown woman in her 40's with high cheekbones and almond-shaped eyes, resplendent in a traditional African gown and headwrap, waiting to talk to us.  It was Deborah Johnson, who had changed her name.  I was immediately transported back to that news clip I'd seen, and the injustice of what had been done to her, and to Fred, and the anguish on her face, and how even as they'd done everything they could to degrade her, how beautiful and strong she looked.  She could see that memory come rushing over me, the recognition, and when I struggled to find words and only succeeded in looking into her eyes with all the sorrow and admiration and love I could muster, crying my guts out, she just beamed stately love back at me, placed her hand on mine, and nodded slowly.One of the most powerful moments of my life.",catofnortherndarknes,1486591933,t3_5sukrz,t1_ddi1ig7,12,0,ddi7u7h,Blackfellas,4,3.0

"I don't know, but I can think of a few possibilities:1) He trusts Trump with the reigns of power.  2) He thinks that Trump agrees with him on surveillance issues.  3) He thinks that the intelligence agencies will be able to ignore what Trump wants enough so that Trump won't a problem.  4) He knows that now that the nation is distracted by the Trump spectacle, this is a good time to sneak in the authoritarian changes.  5) He's been planning to do this for so long that he doesn't want to rethink it now.  6) He cares so much about preventing terrorist attacks than he is blind to the dangers of such powers being available to the government.  Any combination of these, or something I haven't thought of, could explain what's happening. No. In 2007, Obama said: ""I was a constitutional law professor, which means unlike the current president I actually respect the Constitution."" After eight years of Obama, I must admit that I have become skeptical he ever really understood the Constitution to begin with. I still believe that he has probably read the Constitution at least once, but that is about it.We cannot have liberty if we are willing to give the government such powers in reaction to such minor threats. Terrorism is simply not enough of a danger that such powers are justified. The deadliest terrorist attack in US history, which was a one-off attack, killed only about a fifth as many Americans as die every single year at the hand of their fellow Americans. In a more typical year, the number of Americans who die as a result of terrorism is less than 100.

"The way this was always explained to me is that God's forgiveness is a wonderful and free gift.  But much in the way he gives it freely, he expects Christians to do the same.

There is certainly a message here, but let's look at Matthew 5-25.""Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.""The language here is of a legal nature.  It's not a spiritual direction or something vague.  In modern day terms it's like saying ""If the officer gave you a ticket, pay it.  Quickly.  Cause if you don't, the judge is going to send you to jail."" This suggests that there were legal customs surrounding temple offerings.

"OK so men can be shit at expressing themselves (I know I can be) and what seems an off hand comment or reasonable to us can be taken as completely seriously and earnest by our partners. I think he's trying to convey the idea that he thinks those women look great in those outfits and he thinks you would too. His ""asking for attention"" comment could be a ham fisted way of saying ""I think you'd look amazing in a dress like that and any man that saw you would too"". I think the disconnect appears to be that you both have very different views on how attractive you are. You describe yourself as a ""Sausage on stilts"" and wanting clothing that makes sure not everything is shown.I imagine that if you asked him how he views how you look ""dressed up"" you'd find that he thinks you're absolutely gorgeous and could easily pull off such a look. You don't mention in the post but has your sex life together gone a bit stale and this could be his way of trying to inject a bit of the spice back into the relationship? This is obviously complicated by the previous sexual abuse and it's not surprising that this weighs heavily on your mind and is bound to influence your decision making and how comfortable you are with all this. Can I genuinely suggest you sit him down in a place without distractions and explain to him calmly how it all makes you feel. Got through what you've gone through on here - that G-Strings don't make you feel sexy and you feel you aren't the right body shape for the clothing he wants you to wear so rather than feeling sexy you'll feel self conscious and awkward. Gently remind him of the sexual abuse aspect and that it brings back bad memories and horrible emotions for you. Ask him why he's wanting to change the way you dress and if he offers a reasonable explanation perhaps offer a compromise that would be suitable for you both. If it is a sex thing then perhaps you could negotiate to wear some leggings just in the bedroom. If he's trying (failing) to boost your self esteem explore some other options that don't leave you feeling sausage like.Either way the only way you two are going to sort this out is by sitting down together and talking it through.

OK - adoption - if you are trying to adopt a newborn that will ALWAYS be difficult, particularly if you are trying to adopt within the United States.

Consider (I know its hard, very hard, and can present difficulties) adopting someone who is not a newborn. And yes, it is surprisingly a difficult process, largely thanks to the damned evil people that seek to abuse children and target the vulnerable.

I forget the episode, but I recall a few John Oliver jokes that, while not offensive and typically I enjoy his humor, seemed to have some sense of being kind of unaware of how bad heroin addiction is. I think it'd be one thing to do a bit on it, but it's another to make an offhanded comment of, 'Well, at least you're not addicted to heroin.'

"Yeah, I've seen the okcupid data and you're absolutely correct that men prefer women who are in between the age range that you cited. However, a later graph in that same chapter also shows who men are actually attempting to contact and it's radically different than that. Way more dudes contact women who are closer to them in age (not the same, men still skew younger but's it's more like 5 years, whereas women are more likely to contact men slightly closer to them in age). This shows that in the case of OP and women in general, it's not super necessary to let all of your career goals slide in order to find a mate. If the age range that men found the most attractive was ALSO the age range that men tended to message, I'd totally be on board with what you're saying. It's not though.It's also still true to say that the common male-female relationship involves the man being responsible for breadwinning. However, a full 40% of households with kids under 18 have a woman as the breadwinner (and that number has been rising in recent years, and is set to continue rising), so it would likely be wiser for OP and women in general to prioritize being financially stable as well, since that doesn't hinder 40% of US relationships with kids under 18.Finally, women totally put more importance on men having financial stability than vice versa. But making your plans based on a nebulous someone in the future that you may or may not meet to provide for you seems kind of poor planning.

If you are in the context of a hospital or a lab, and it is important to know what chromosomes someone was born with, the persons feelings shouldnt be considered at all when labeling them. In the context of a genetic man with boobs wanting to be called she because they want to blend in and be accepted, it is totally different. Yes, technically they are still genetically one way, but in everyday life, labels are only as good as their usefulness to people and society.

"I was lucky to be raised an Air Force brat stationed 3 years in Germany and 4 in The Netherlands.  Being active duty military, you could get a really discounted rate to stay in the local Patton and Von Steuben hotels.  As a kid in the late 80's, it felt like being in the Overlook hotel in the Patton, and such a strange sense of knowing that it once held countless soldiers but we were there for a ski trip.The Zugspitze is the tallest mountain in all of Germany, so naturally a great place to learn how to ski.  I swear the local kids were born with skis on (which had to hurt their mothers on the way out), because there were often 2-5 year old kids that would ski between your legs just for fun.  The Germans also didn't feel the need to go overboard in marking the cliff edges on the mountain, so as a tourist that didn't have the sense to stay in the center of the run, I shot full speed off the cliff and hit every branch on the way down and had to be airlifted out.  Lucky/Unlucky for me, I have a genetic hypermobility disorder so my bones were more bendy than break-y.  But I still feel like I earned a shirt that says ""You can't kill me motherfucker"".If you can ever find the way to go and visit Bavaria area, you absolutely should go see the many castles dotted around the countryside like Linderhof and Neuschwanstein.  Whether you like to hike, ski, take photographs, geocache, or you're a history buff (and a million other reasons), try and get over there once in your life.

"I'll provide context for anyone who doesn't know how this game structures its story.In your first playthrough, you play through a particular series of events as 2B, putting you on track for Ending A. In your second playthrough, you witness roughly the same span of time but as 9S; because the pair stick together for the most part, the B route is mostly the same, but there are some important differences. After you get Ending B, your third playthrough instead tells the story of what happens *after* the events depicted in the A/B routes. This final playthrough has roughly the same amount of story content as Route A, meaning it's basically the second half of the game; this means it contains many of the pay-offs to story elements set up in the first half.Our reviewer here stopped apparently around the beginning of his Route B playthrough, meaning he totally missed some of the story elements he complained about getting resolved. Oddly, he also seems to have forgotten that one thing he does complain about *was* addressed during the first playthrough: [](#s ""the aliens. You see their decaying bodies in the underground base, which get a nice, long camera cut and expressions of confusion from 2B and 9S.

They tend to have a little final boost when ending because when airing the score counts all ratings but when it ends it counts only those that have watched 1/5 of the show. Therefore those that dropped it at ep 1/2 and rated it very low are not taken in consideration anymore. Moreover some users don't score until they finish a show so they contribute as well at the end. The ending is a big thing for a lot of people so it can raise the scores even further or throw away 3/4 hours of investment in the show.,zalmatan,1484818184,t3_5ov6xq,t3_5ov6xq,3,0,dcmf5n8,anime,5,0.6

"There are plenty of laws in China governing IP. I worked with a firm in China that represented companies like Blackberry and Mars. The big problem is enforcement. The Chinese police and court system is so corrupt that every single overseas partnership insists upon arbitration.Arbitration can help in certain instances. We dealt with a Blackberry factory that only had to operate at half capacity to fulfill legitimate orders. Of course, they ran at full capacity and sold the other half themselves. Arbitration allowed a relatively seamless process to penalize the Chinese factory and prevent further counterfeits.On the other hand, we had a case where a company was producing fake Dove chocolate bars. As an aside, the Chinese love Dove bars and Buick for some reason. Anyways, as usual, we had to do all the investigatory work. We hired people to videotape the inside of the factory, etc. Since Mars had no business affiliation, we had to go through the court system. This involves sitting down and literally bribing judges over dinner to look into the case. Long story short, The counterfeit chocolate maker was eventually forced to move its operations but no civil or criminal penalties were leveled. The cat and mouse game just started over.Similarly, it was very difficult dealing with retailers that sold counterfeit items. It was impossible to keep them out of smaller shops. We constantly had to secret shop the bigger outlets but again, they would just take them off the shelves for a time. No civil action ever got through. It was a constant battle.My point is it wouldn't matter what changes are made to Chinese policy since they don't follow their current. China doesn't give a shit about foreign interests.

"It's completely logical AND reasonable. Let's just take one small facet of a common religion. The belief that gay marriage is wrong. 1. God abhors sin2. Homosexuality is a sin3. If you sin, you must repent4. Homosexuals do not repent their sinful behavior5. Gay marriage codifies sin and the state sponsors it. That seems pretty logical and according to the internal logic of a facet of Christianity. You disagreeing doesn't make it unreasonable, which is why the belief persists and it takes a fundamental total shift in belief. Just like we'd consider the wholesale slaughter of civilians unreasonable; atheist Soviets and Maoists demanded it. Personally, I think in the case of the Soviets and Maoists they threw it back to dictator worship; which isn't strictly atheism, which is why as an atheist I experience no cognitive dissonance on the issue.

"My individual view is honestly one you'll probably laugh at considering that you view me as a cartoon Nazi. I personally don't baselessly hate, individual merit is important to me and while I will admit to having preconceived notions, my mind can be changed on their own characteristics and qualities. The preferred end goal for me is just to get people to accept the science that is genetics, and open their eyes to the massive anti-white conspiracy around them for our own survival. I don't care about the wholesale eviction of any non whites for the sake of being nonwhite, if relocation can happen peacefully for both parties I'm on board but let's be real here. I just want an area where I can be around white people, have white babies and get rid of the double standard. I don't want to have to sacrifice merit in the name of diversity, and I don't want to have to feel bad for preferring the company of whites.Now for the most common goal for what most alt-righters are, white nationalists, is about the same thing. The most reasonable end goal is a return to a nationalistic world, where a societies individual culture is allowed to evolve, grow and become its own thing alongside the others. They want a white ethnostate to preserve their heritage and culture, not unlike what many other ethnic groups have, it's just vilified by outsiders due to the conditioning done by the mainstream to view that as an evil idea.I'll go more in depth or answer any specific questions if you want, but first can I ask why you assume we're all here out of baseless ignorance?

They brought him back into the public image positively and glossed over the face that he killed so many people in his baseless wars. That's a tiny tiny bit of history revisionism at play and the most recent example. The 5 million non Jew holocaust number was just casually dropped down ridiculously as soon as someone with power called them out on it.

"Ok subhumans is too far but not everything here is serious anyway. Degenerate is a very plain term. Degeneracy means evidence of decline, degenerates are people who engage in lesser behavior. It is not a sign of insecurity, and I have no idea how you think it makes me self loathing? I like who I am.   Wrong, I just recognize that there are sick people in society who need to be called out.

Hostility is inherent in nature, even in the animal kingdom different tribes of animals are hostile to foreigners to protect what they have.

I'd rather be the watchdog against subversion and be 'insecure' than allow society to accept trash like pedophiles and have achieved your standard of personal security.  I prefer standing up for what I believe is right than you thinking I'm secure in myself. In fact, yielding in my beliefs due to others judgement is a greater sign of insecurity than sticking up for what I believe in. I'm secure in myself, people who espouse beliefs such as moral relativism are the ones I view as less secure in themselves.   People can do nothing to change that?

"I have a really poor relationship with my father. He didn't come to my actual graduation - no excuse was given. He did come to the banquet afterwards, but made my entire family late - I waited at my table by myself while everyone sat and talked with their families. In all honesty, I don't think I'll have much of a relationship with him once I'm fully dependent. It simply is not healthy to have that stress in my life. For people to want to improve, they need to want it. It sounds like you want it, but he doesn't. Its best not to expect too much from people like this. It only leads to disappointment. I do, however, have a great mom who makes up for every ounce of it. I love her. Congratulations on graduation!

Nobody has to support anyone. It's the candidates job to compel people to support and vote for them.

He has yet to put his official platform up and he keeps talking about Russia. The average person doesn't give a shit about Russia and the fact that he keeps talking about it anyway tells me he might be listening to Dem consultants and higher-ups which would mean he'd likely be willing to listen to them about dropping any progressive issues he's mentioned as well.

"Even that is not so simple...According to a study at Carnegie Mellon University, certain vegetables will actually have a higher impact on emissions compared to specific animal products. It's mainly based on comparing food sources on a per-calorie basis, rather than a direct weight comparison (Like you wouldn't replace a pound of meat with a pound of broccoli that has half the amount of calories, you need to replace on a per-calorie basis to get adequate nutrition and a more accurate comparison). A lot of the low-calorie vegetables require such a high level of consumption to get an equivalent number of calories to meat that when you look at water, energy, and emissions they actually end up with a significantly higher impact. There are also differences in energy efficiencies between animals, like chicken is much more efficient than beef due to not using as much energy in their lifetime per kilo of meat (there's a greater return of investment in regards to the energy provided to them in their food and then the energy they give us back as food).It's overall a pretty complicated issue. So the overall message of the study was: not *all* vegetables are better than *all* meat, but there are ways to be smarter about consumption, such as choosing vegetables with higher energy density, animal products with higher efficiency, etc. Aditionally, probably one of the easiest ways to reduce emissions through our diets is to just get portion sizes under control. If we just all collectively *ate less*, we could decrease emissions by a decent amount.",drebunny,1486743535,t3_5t7656,t1_ddkqxcd,4,0,ddkthj0,science,671,0.005961251862891207

"""Socialism,"" or any sort of welfare state, even if only for whites. It subsidizes degeneracy, since they are the only ones who need it. You subsidize something, you get more of it. If you want to preserve the future of the white race, you don't do it by encouraging the least intelligent and least fit of your race to continue reproducing at the highest rates.  A complete absence of state-enforced welfare. Or, at least a welfare policy that is designed to encourage good breeding--for example, policies which create incentives to encourage those with the ""best"" genes to reproduce more, and disincentives for reproduction imposed on the lower rungs of the gene pool.Yeah, it sounds harsh. But the reality is that other ethnostates have already begun embracing eugenics policies in order to improve their own gene pools. This means that if poor breeding habits among whites continue unmitigated, the white race will be at a competitive disadvantage that will inevitably lead to whites not only losing any competitive advantages against other races enjoyed thus far, but ultimately being wiped out completely.The only way eugenics policies become irrelevant is if AI and gene editing technology makes massive advances in the next few decades. This is very plausible, and perhaps even probable, but in that case, any discussion about ""race"" also quickly becomes irrelevant--there is no reason to attach oneself to any particular race when a ""perfect"" human being can be deliberately designed at the gene level with any characteristics deemed most desirable. But, as long as races ""matter,"" so do breeding practices. The alt-right believes that race matters.

Insurance companies made money selling these policies to healthy people-including infants. Its simply managing the actuarial tables to guarantee profitability. The reason this is libertarian-leaning is that it actually gets government out of healthcare more so than any other plan out there... and uses the free market to help get costs under control by making the consumer more price-aware/price-conscious.It's also using commercial instruments to back a government program instead of using the US as the guarantor...

They convinced him in his ignorance to how reddit works to remove himself as the moderator of the moosearchive sub with the rationale that since it was an archive and he'd made it so no one could post anything new into the sub, there was no need for a moderator.~~Once he ~~stepped down~~ **was inactive long enough** as moderator, they then proceeded to apply for moderator status in his sub, which was granted as it was considered an abandoned subreddit now, since there was no longer any **active** moderator, and they turned it into a Hillary Clinton-themed subreddit.

Moose ~~left reddit shortly after, I imagine devastated~~ **is hopefully blissfully ignorant of their actions**.

"I think you should look into micro loans. To understand what makes money valuable (since it doesn't have inherent value), you have to look at trade and debt. The more money changes hands, the more value is made out of these exchanges. Taxation is just another form of currency exchange. I'd argue that rich people, hoarding money like Smaug or Scrooge McDuck, stagnate trade and are bad for the economy around them. There's a reason trickle-down economics didn't work (Reaganomics). Disbursing money doesn't always help the economic growth either. In the Bush Jr. years they tried multiple times to disburse money to combat the downturn resulting from multiple bubbles bursting until the disastrous subprime mortgage debacle. When times are hard, handing money to people doesn't encourage them to spend it and improve trade and economic prosperity, they tend to horde it until they absolutely need it.",SobriKate,1487804807,t3_5vluar,t3_5vluar,1,0,de35dca,changemyview,37,0.027027027027027032

"Yeah, because a worker earning a million during his prime working age (till age 56) can bring up 6-7 children on his money alone, when a single child has upbringing costs of ~230.000. Sources: http://money.aol.co.uk/2014/06/27/average-worker-earns-1-million-by-the-time-they-turn-56/https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/16/cost-of-raising-children-in-uk-higher-than-everEven with all the desire in the world, how would you bring up more than 1-2 children on such a budget? The only way is how poor people do it: Let the state pay the bill (while living in poverty all their lives).The middle class can't afford to pour lots of ressources into a child AND have lots of children. If you imagine a single-earner household, a single child eats up ~20% of the overall budget, two children up to 40%. Thats a huge investment, even if you don't count the time investment into this number. So, nobody has children because they are a tremendous burden onto the family/parents. Even if you try to avoid this money trap by sending both parents to work (DINK households) more children making it harder and harder for both parents to juggle their time schedule of work and family life. And even then, if you life in big cities like London or Paris....you might not even be able to afford anything with just a normal job due to the abysmal living costs. Actually, no normal earner can afford to live in these cities anyways.In Japan the situation is a step further ahead: People avoid relationships altogether since they can not afford to spend that much time and money on other people. And honestly: Working long hours in a highly flexible job with high job insecurities while trying to have a nice and comfy family life just doesn't mix well.

"It was a case presented to Al Ghazali, but it was a bit different in that you had to throw a few people overboard to save the rest of the passengers on a boat. It's actively killing someone vs. letting someone die through inaction in the case presented by OP.     [...] Al-Ghazali gave three reasons against the justification of killing in this case of the abandoned ship:   2. Necessity: the benefit of those people on the boat is not necessary to a degree to break another necessity and kill humans.  3. Certainty: we are not certain that killing those people is going to save the rest. What if they killed them and after that they faced another problem at sea, should they kill another 10 people to save the rest? This is morally unjustifiable and becomes out of control.

It is mostly an unrepresented mandate. The branch of government that is supposed to pass legislation did not debate or vote on the issue. We have never as a country had the debate of the crucial question - Should we intervene in a healthy pregnancy? I personally think the answer is yes we should because when two lives share a body the rights of the mother should be primary. We should empower government to grant a very strict and limited exception to the legal treatment of risk for the unique situation of pregnancy. The problem with Roe V. Wade is that lawsuits are not the place to create new law.,mrhymer,1485108671,t3_5pi782,t3_5pi782,10,0,dcre2dp,AskTrumpSupporters,198,0.0505050505050505

"1 - The crazy side of the argument is getting out of hand. ""Punch a Nazi"", ""hate speech is not protected"", these are fundamentally anti-democratic ideas. I can explain more if that's not readily apparent.I understand why people would want to physically attack people who are being assholes - I remember wishing someone would knock out Fred Phelps when I was younger.I also get why people wouldn't want to hear/see repulsive or offensive speech. There's plenty of stuff I don't want to see.And I can understand why people would think that the violence and prohibitions were harmless when aimed at racists, and why they would think these were good for society.But I fundamentally disagree, because I strong believe that democracy is one of our greatest achievements. And suppressing the free expression of ideas - any ideas - is detrimental to democracy.I also remember when the PATRIOT Act was first going around. The idea was that we'd invade the privacy of terrorists to stop terrorism. Sounded good, but it quickly spun out of hand, into invading the privacy of *everyone.*The Bill of Rights is an amazing document. I'm super skeptical of anyone who wants to mess with it.2 - I believe that 20-40% of my fellow citizens would be willing to sacrifice a bit of free speech so they could avoid offensive ideas and feel safe from this Nazi boogeyman that they've been convinced exists.I think that's a much, much more dangerous precedent than they realize.",SlutBuster,1503094396,t3_6ukekv,t3_6ukekv,12,0,dltidqa,AskThe_Donald,225,0.05333333333333334

"/u/spappletrap What I have heard is that people called each other Wahhabis to divide the ~~Shias and the Sunnis~~ Muslims from following that which is correct. Whatever the case however, it is true that calling somebody a Wahhabi is a way to divide the _ummah_. As I said before, it is not befitting for you to call somebody a Salafi, unless you make clear that a Salafi means ""follower of the Salaf ([righteous] predecessors)"". Just like a Sunni means follower of the Sunnah (teachings and sayings of the Prophet, peace be upon him). That is because Allah says (interpretation of the meaning: Call me a Muslim or call me a kafir. As I said before, there is no Shia/Sunni/whateveri in Islam. Dividing each other is a deviance. ""In his Khutbah the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) used to praise Allah as He deserves to be praised, then he would say: _'Whomsoever Allah (SWT) guides, none can lead him astray, and whomsoever Allah sends astray, none can guide. The truest of word is the Book of Allah and best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst of things are those that are newly invented; **every newly-invented thing is an innovation and every innovation is going astray, and every going astray is in the Fire.**'_ Then he said: _'The Hour and I have been sent like these two.'_ Whenever he mentioned the Hour, his cheeks would turn red, and he would raise his voice and become angry, as if he were warning of an approaching army and saying: _'An army is coming to attack you in the morning, or in the evening!'_ (Then he said): _'Whoever leaves behind wealth, it is for his family, and whoever leaves behind a debt or dependents, then these are my responsibility, and I am the most entitled to take care of the believers.'""_  The question is not what label you wear, but rather what you believe and what you do.",2manyusernamestaken,1486032591,t3_5rjop6,t1_dd86uwy,1,0,dd8bf45,islam,29,0.03448275862068965

"Cotton rope does tend to be on the 'bigger' size, so 1/4'' is pretty typical for it. I, personally, haven't used cotton before but I've been thinking of adding it to my collection for a while.Crash course on bondage rope: jute and hemp are what you'd usually use. Most of the people in your BDSM scene are going to be using one of these two; I'm no exception, I use jute rope. Most people also use it in 6 mm, which is a bit thinner than 1/4' and I think 1/2' would be way too thick for standard rope bondage. But it all comes down to personal preference and how strong you need the rope to be, anyway; I work with 5 mm jute, usually, because I have slender fingers and it's easier for me to work with than 6 mm.If you're looking for soft rope, you're right to look at cotton. Good cotton rope holds knots better than the other soft ropes (MFP, nylon, silk) and has a strong working load. However, if you're thinking of doing suspension, don't use cotton rope for that; I've heard that cotton rope knots tend to clench more than usual so it's difficult to work with for suspension.Here's a good site that'll help elaborate more on rope and where to buy it: http://crash-restraint.com/ties/2Also, before you tie someone, make sure you have EMT sheers and you learn about rope safety. You can cause lasting nerve damage and other permanent issues if you tie incorrectly.

"I've had plenty of bad experiences, but this one takes the cake.I go to bowling every week with my agency's staff and their clients (it's one of those that helps kids with disabilities). I go there one day, pay up, all that, only to find a new kid there, about 10 or so. Immediately my brain kicks into ""O SHIT NEW KID YASSSSS"" mode. However, I'm socially awkward so I didn't talk to him.He started to make loud noises and chirps and all of that, and started to say ""bowl bowl bowl SCORE!"" whenever a ball would roll down a lane and hit pins. I had a headache because I had slept horribly last night, so hearing this kid wasn't the best highlight of my day. He worsened my headache, but he didn't worsen my bowling score--I got 80 on the first game and 73 on the second. Still, I worked up the nerves to get him to stop, but he never listened. Kept it up the entire time I was there.I haven't seen him since. I don't know where he went now.BONUS VERY-CRINGY TALE: I went to my local park with a social group I go to weekly (same agency). My staff member who was with me Wednesdays (the same day the bowling group meets) came with a new girl, Jayden. She was a bit of a chubby girl, had no friends--and I could see why: she basically had this Oshawott and Vaporeon Pokemon toys she played with 24/7. Even in the water. Where there were a bunch of kids staring. Yikes.The staff member who was with her told me to make friends with her. Way to put me on the spot, lady. I'm socially awkward, there are like 3 other teens capable of holding a fucking conversation, yet you want *me* to talk to this girl?So basically I introduced myself. That was it. Never went any further. I did cringe inwardly though.Then when we were breaking to eat, she asked me about a bite mark on my arm. I bite myself due to my abusive mother and me getting frustrated that I'm not impressing her/living up to her expectations. I've done it so much it's now a brown rough patch.She asked me about it. In a really loud voice. *HOLY SHIT.* I know she's autistic, but she had to put me on the spot? Siiiiigh.Again, criiiiiinge. I lied and said that yeah, a boy did bite me. I never spoke to her again and now I feel extremely guilty.She only comes once in a blue moon now as she's afraid of large crowds.

"I was specifically saying that they don't elevate workers, and that doing so is exactly contrary to the goal. To even employ others is contrary to the goal if there's any way that labor can be avoided, or done by fewer people, or done more cheaply as we'll see in coming years with the rise of automation. Just like during the industrial revolution, or the stagnant wages since the 70s despite a doubling of productivity, or today with outsourcing, the profit will flow upwards.That people can elevate their own condition *is not more true in America*. Social mobility in the US has been on a steady decline. Of 12 countries researchers investigated, the US came in [dead last](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Patterns_of_mobility) in social mobility. The American Dream is more alive in Denmark than here.Government in America has historically been used both as a barrier and as an equalizer, depending on the goals of those in power. Teddy Roosevelt was a champion of the progressive movement. Today people think of progressivism as SJWs arguing on Tumblr, when in reality you owe workplace safety regulations, the abolitionist of child labor, the 8 hour workday, the regulation of the very food you consume to it. Government does not work for the people when massive companies lobby public officials to their whim, and when regulatory capture is taking place. It is a form of corruption. This is the true example of greed, as those with great wealth seek to grow their wealth further. Even Adam Smith, father of capitalism, explicitly warned that it must be checked, and the government is the only entity capable of doing so.That you say welfare and social programs make society more greedy is asinine. The very purpose of those programs is to curb the inherent continually redistribution of wealth upwards to those who are encouraged by greed in a capitalist system. This means that social programs *are the very means by which social mobility becomes easier*. A small government without any social programs is not an example of a developed nation, and the most extreme versions are what we call failed states.",jvalordv,1492279981,t3_65cegp,t1_dgaxtvc,1,0,dgayora,esist,642,0.001557632398753894

"I don't know that much about schizophrenia but I'll take your word on the distinctions you laid out. Seems fair enough.I don't think people should be prevented from undergoing surgery or hormone therapy. But I certainly don't think those people are now a different gender. Nor do I think taxes should support it. Especially since surgery/therapy doesn't seem to help. I hope they know all the information beforehand so they can make whatever decision they see fit. At best, it's inconclusive, but honestly, it doesn't look helpful.I also question whether or not proponents of hormone therapy and the surgery as treatments would agree that medication to dissolve the dysphoria is anything other than abuse. The current prevailing attitude amongst those proponents, as it seems to me, is that the mind is real and the body is the problem. I don't think many people want a medication for it to just go away. Maybe I'm wrong about that but all the conversation about solving the problem is going the other direction of how to change ones body instead, even when that route has proven to worsen the condition if anything (the swedish study, assuming you're familiar with it). I understand the ""this is the best we've got"" argument. Better to do something than nothing. Sometimes you can't do anything more than treating the symptoms. If you're trying to match 2 incongruent things and you can only change 1 then of course that's your only option. I get it. But what I'm saying is I don't see trans activists interested in actually changing how the mind feels about the body. I think people are quite content with the lack of medication to make it all go away so the ""surgery and hormones are just the best we can do"" argument sounds to me like a really soft way of saying ""this is the way we want it.""",Nonethewiserer,1500774718,t3_6ovn98,t1_dkl969z,2,0,dkl9ofi,Conservative,142,0.014084507042253518

"Do you realize that a massive portion of the entertainment consumed by humans revolves around tragedy? What do you think of the notion that western entertainment was historically founded upon the concepts of both tragedy and comedy? Today, audiences are paying money to see people die. I bet you have been in that audience. You might put forth the fictitious nature of that entertainment, but I'd counter with the following: Fake violence on the screen is completely inspired by real violence. You're watching dramatized (sometimes not even that much) reenactments of violence that actually happened. Sure, you may feel badly for the victims of the fictional violence, and so you'd assert the extant sympathy proven by your bad feeling, but that does nothing to detract from the actual fact that you were entertained by it all. You enjoyed seeing the turmoil and pain; so much so, that you'll probably pay to watch the sequel. Why is that less bad than finding humor in tragedy? After all, the concepts were born together, with comedy as a reminder of the absurdity that envelopes the entire idea of tragedy. Dark humor is, generally, impersonal. It's tantamount to religion, in that it is, as others have said, a coping mechanism. Why should be only mourn and cry, when there are other, less painful options? Morality is not a universal force, and so no one is consigned to adhere to any particular outline. It's the absurdity of the details of the events that are humorous most of the time, and other times, it's the unexpected and clever observation that induces a chuckle.

"You need to decide if you can have sex without needing to be in a relationship.Of course you got hurt after sex when you realized it was just about pussy for them. That's really dehumanizing and, even if consciously they were just dick for you, part of you hurts because you know your so much more than your genitals. I hate truly casual sex. It makes me feel bad about myself. Because I don't feel respected. But I also realized I don't need or even want emotions necessarily. And thats where I discovered the golden sweet spot: the fuck buddy.The fuck buddy is a guy you really get along with but don't have an interest in dating eachother for whatever reason. Quite literally friends with benefits. The  key is you have to have a deal breaker be for you start. You need to be able to be really firm that you're not interested in him or else one of you is likely to catch feelings. For me I would find guys where we got along but we were just totally fundamentally different. People I would be friends with and get along fine but the idea of dating them was just Blegh. What was most important was that we established trust and mutual respect. All the safe guards that come within sex in a relationship, just minus the relationship.You can't have sex with a dude you kind of like and never define anything and hope it works out. It never will. You need to find a guy you like and then have a firm conversation about what both of you want, whether those wants are compatible, and if so, the expectations going forward.I had a fuck buddy where we agreed to be monogomous (we were both uncomfortable with the idea of performing unprotected oral if the other was sleeping with the people).If you have emotional feelings, then you have to respect that and be honest with them. There's no wrong or right when it comes to being single. But I think the number one problem women have is they don't feel confident in asserting themselves and respecting their own desires. If you're sleeping with a guy and catch feels, tell him. If you want sex but get jealous easily, tell him. Figure out what you want and then demand it. You'll weed out the guys who aren't going to give it to you. You wouldnt just going with the flow and hope things turn out alright for you when it came to coursework or a haircut, why would you think it'd work for your sex life?I think whats happening is you're being a little too casual and it makes you feel disposable. That's shitty. Even if its not in a monogamous romantic relationship, you should always feel comfortable and safe with a sexual partner. If you cant have difficult conversations, you shouldn't be having sex with them.Find guys you like and get along with. Discuss what you want. Establish a relationship. Get familiar with eachother. Make sure he respects you and isnt gonna treat you poorly.That said, if you're not dating a guy, you have to accept he might start dating someone else. If him ending his fling with you and dating someone else makes you sad, thats a *really* strong indicator you shouldn't have been having the fling to begin with. Its ok to have feelings. Dont deny them just because they're not what you wanted them to be. Fucking around and toughening up is soul crushing and awful. Dont do that. Learning the difference between sexual intimacy and emotional intimacy and the relationship between the two (which varies for everybody) is an important lesson to learn. Learning to ask for what you want and walk away from situations that don't meet y out standards is also important to learn. Learning to listen to yourself and figuring out what you want is a lesson we never stop learning. It sounds like you've been trying to reach an end result without paying attention to the ingredients. You cant have a casual sexual relationship with someone you have feelings for. You can't have sex with someone who doesn't like you as a human being and be surprised it was just about sex for them. If you want to feel valued as a complete person, you need to put in the leg work and ""date"" some guys and find a good fit.I date completely normally. I find guys I really click with and am attracted to. I get to know them over the course of hanging out a few times. Sometimes I really have feelings and I tell them I like them. Sometimes I realize the connection is more shallow and tell them I don't want anything serious. I just always try to pay attention to what I want vs what I think I want. Sometimes I think I want sex and really I want someone to hold me and tell me they care about me. Sometimes I think I have feelings for a guy but in reality I just really like the sex and its clouding my judgement . I always keep a dude though. I always have that one fuck buddy who's just a stand up guy. A guy who is dependable (nothing worse than a booty call going unresponded to for hours). He's respectful. The sex is good. The conversation before and after the sex is good. And there's something that makes me not want to date him. He's my human dildo. I like the dick *and I also like the human it's attached to*. But I don't have feelings for him.Being single is rough. Getting hurt sucks. Getting hurt is part of life. But it doesn't need to be part of your sex life. Figuring out why you're getting hurt and try out solutions. Figure out what works and what doesnt (and casual sex doesn't work for a lot of people. There's nothing wrong with needing emotional intimacy to be able to enjoy sexual intimacy. Its common and until *super* recently was the societal norm). Nobody here can give you advice because it's a compeltely unique introspective issue.",Polaritical,1480659650,t3_5g046t,t3_5g046t,3,0,daosqo9,TwoXChromosomes,41,0.07317073170731707

"The presumption under all systems based on English common law is that you have rights until they are explicitly limited, not that enumerated rights offer protection of behavior that might otherwise be limited at will.

A pulse through the whole story that you can't escape. It reads itself - reads like it was a peom. And that while asking serious questions about self identity in child friendly ways and providing never ending inspiration for the mind of a young reader. * Night Watch - Sergei LukyanenkoUrban Fantasy / Gothik / Noir inspired detective novel in Moscow wherein the likeable Andrej has to find a cursed woman while being in the crossfire of both the Night and Daywatch. Here - it's all about atmosphere for me. The dialogue is spot on, the protagonist is unusual and yet I loved walking through the city with him.* Isaac Asimov - I'm RobotThis one has just a special place in my heart and it wouldn't feel right to not have it on this list. It's not just the first Science-Fiction Novel I have ever read in my life, it's also the first ""not written for children""-book I've read.

My mother died many years ago and it's possible that I may have had an idealized image of her in my mind when she passed. I never learned how to ride a bike. My mother tried to teach me but I was not good at it and I eventually gave up. Then years after her death a relative told me that she had actually sabotaged me. Apparently she thought it was dangerous but rather than forbidding me to do it she adjusted the seat and pedals in such a way as to make it impossible to ride. And because I was so young and clueless about bike riding I never figured it out. After trying for a long time I just decided it was something I wasn't capable of unlike my friends and neighbors.If she really thought it was dangerous it would have been kinder to simply forbid me from doing it. But if she had I might have thought negatively of her. So she thought it would be better for me to think negatively of myself.This is the kind of 4D chess that women are always playing out in their heads.

"No, there is quite solid science out there demonstrating that we are able to sensorially detect fat. Triglycerides could be shown to be hydrolyzed to generate free fatty acids by lipase released from the van Ebners salivary glands. Receptor proteins like GPR120 can then be activated by the free fatty acids. Interestingly, it could be shown that it is not the fatty acid receptor activation alone which gives us the fatty or creamy oral sensation.

"Yeah.. No.Belgium has what is for all intents and purposes a single payer system. There are organisations between the government and the patients that handle repayment, but they are financed by the government. The fact that they exists (and are sometimes called health insurance) does not change the fact that it's a single payer system.They're an artefact of Belgian political history. Mostly so that the christian, liberal and socialist political wings could have their own organisations. They don't really take much money. People must be registered with such a service, but the health care is not financed by them. For example, I pay mine 50 or 75 euro a year (I forget how much, because it's a trivial bill). Clearly that's insufficient to pay for health care.Health care in Belgium is financed by the government out of taxes. The government negotiates prices and it decides what treatments get paid and what treatments do not.I'm not sufficiently familiar with those other countries, but I strongly suspect many of them do in fact also have what amounts to single payer systems.The simple fact about health care is that just about everyone will need it, and that insurance schemes work best with large risk pools. It's only sensible to just have everyone be insured, and then it only makes sense to have the government do this. I'm well aware of the instinctual distrust people in the USA have of government services, but the fact is that health care outcomes in the USA are significantly worse than those in other first-world countries.

"I chalk that up to more of a literary device - needing a clear set of villains with black and white morality to make it accessible to children - than a failing of the base concept. All children's stories have simple morality.**EDIT**:  I'd also like to comment a little on Snape.  The only times we ever really see him being a poor mentor to the house are in interactions with Potter and his friends.  Keep in mind that Snape is dealing with some pretty serious psychological issues (which we don't learn until later books).  Harry is a living, breathing reminder that the woman Snape was hopelessly in love with married the boy who harrassed and tortured him throughout his entire childhood/formative years (they even remark that Harry looks almost exactly like James) - imagine what it would be like to see the spitting image of the man who made your life hell for damn near a decade sitting in your class every day.  This is to say nothing of the fact that Snape felt he was indirectly responsible for that same woman (whom he loved) being brutally murdered by the man whom he had sworn allegiance too - an act that was so offensive to Snape that he _changed sides_ in one of the greatest conflicts in the history of the wizarding world.  Snape, to say the very least, had issues and those issues came out in how he dealt with Harry.  You can't judge the entire house by the actions of a single man who was dealing with some serious stuff.",Ansuz07,1497534771,t3_6hdjjc,t1_dixrzr6,3,0,dixs4e5,changemyview,79,0.0379746835443038

"Oh, and my coworkers are the opposite type.  I'm the type you described.  My coworkers think they are God's gift to Japan and that they are single-handedly going to change them from a bunch of xenophobic little robots into critically-thinking masters of English.  The students that actually have a chance go to private English schools for that.  The English taught in schools is beyond horrible.  I think they'd be better off learning nothing, as opposed to what they actually do learn.  All pronunciations are taught in katakana/Japanese pronunciations, so they can neither understand nor speak actual English.  They speak Japanese English.Like, what other country is that arrogant, that they say something like, ""Hmm.  'Bordeaux is too hard to pronounce, and the spelling doesn't make sense.  We will teach it as 'bordo'.  Perfect.  Next word.""Because that's what they do.  For every single word, they ignore the actual pronunciations, and just practice katakana pronunciations.  ""Fun"" becomes ""fan"", ""the"" becomes ""za"", ""test"" becomes ""tesuto"", and on and on.These are 15-17 year old students, who have been practicing English for at least three years, and they still can't pronounce a ""th"", lone ""s"", or differentiate between ""l"" and ""r"".  Many of these students have been studying since Elementary school.  10 years of English lessons, and they have 0 practical English skills.

"Start by assuming a different set of honestly held knowledge and beliefs:-An *honest* belief that things like climate change are lies told by liberals trying to gain political power through hysteria.  You believe in climate change because smart people you trust told you it exists.  They believe climate change is a hoax because smart people *they* trust told them it is.  I agree with you that we're factually right and they're factually wrong, but the basic way we've come about our beliefs is not that different.-An *honest* belief that homosexuality is a curable condition which causes pain and suffering to those afflicted with it.  They've certainly seen gay people suffering in their communities, probably seen a lot of them commit suicide. And they've certainly seen 'success stories' come out of gay conversion camps, presenting a happy face to the world as far as they can tell.  Add to this an *honest* belief that anyone who stays gay will literally burn for a literal eternity in hell, and how can it be anything but compassionate to try to correct these disordered people into a life where they can be happier and can end up in heaven with their loved ones?-An *honest belief* that deregulation and lowering taxes will lead to more efficient markets that will raise all boats and make the world better for everyone.  You don't even need to stretch very far to see how they could believe this, there are plenty of entirely mainstream economists and pundits who argue this point, and many social liberals give it a lot of credence.  Again, if you really believe this is better for everyone in the long run, then it's compassionate to advocate for it.Etc.  If you have specific right-wing views you can't understand even given this framework, I'm happy to explain... but I think you can see how this works.  Different life experiences lead to different assumptions about the world and therefore different conclusions about what should be done.

Actually, I considered myself alt-right for a while before I even realized the connotations/source of that label and what people might think about that. I thought it just meant ""alternative right"". You know, like ""alternative rock"" or something. If mods just banned them because they don't like racists that's fine, I guess, maybe a bit chilling, but I'd like them to just admit it. I don't care about partisanship, I care about lies.I'm interested to know *why* exactly they were banned. If there was a good reason, a solid reason, so be it, but was it just politics? Were the admins hoping to push alt-right people towards T_D and isolate us? I just don't know.

For me, my guy virginity kinda seemed not as big a deal (i have no reason why...). But with a girl i want it to certainly be special and with the right person. I was in the exact same position as you! I used grindr and found a really amazing guy my age who was experiencinced but was more than happy to go as slow as i wanted. We went on a date yesterday and i thought the most i would do is give a hug at the end of the night. I had such a great time and felt so comfortable i ended up giving my first BJ also. But it was all at my pace. I had a lot of fun experimenting and trying something new. So i hope this gives insight into a very similar situation. But honestly just go with your gut. If he's a good guy and it naturally progresses that way. Then enjoy it.

And the film never really encurages you to think about these things. I liked the film quite a lot myself. To my surprise actually since I've been quite middeling to Senkai's films after 5cm/s.

"Did you ever read Ibn Taymiyyah's treatise of ""Difference of opinion among madhabs""? He clearly states there that Abu Hanifa and Imam Shafii didn't have access to every single hadith (this is one of the reasons Imam Abu Hanifa considered Qiyas as valid while Imam Ahmad completely rejected Qiyas - during the time of Abu Hanifa and Sufian At-thawri, the number of Hadith fabrications increased tremendously thanks to thee sunni-shia war brewing). What imam Shafii received as Hadith, Abu Hanifa didn't. Like the hadith of rafa yadain for example. This was one of the reasons there was difference of opinions among the imams of madhabs. There were other reasons too, but they're irrelevant to the discussion.Regarding, Imam Nawawi (rahmahullah), every scholar (including non salafi ones) knows that he erred in 2 important things: 1) Errors in explaining Asma of Allaah and 2) Concept of Tawassul through Prophet (where he mistook tawassul via virtue of Sunnah with tawassul through propet directly - there's a hadeeth where the latter practice was rejected by the sahaba after the death of the Prophet Muhammad, while the former was kept in practice). If you read Usool of Hadeeth (which I'm currently studying- and I'm using different sources and books to get a clearer picture), they mention that the muhaddith **can** make mistakes in classifying a hadith (this is due to incomplete knowledge in biography of narrators and their islamic positions before death). Imam Bukhari's books are the most sahih, no doubt. But later muhaddith pointed out that even he wasn't infallible, and there were slightly weaker narrations found (extremely few) in his books. Musnad of Imam Ahmad for example, had weak narrations too, but that doesn't mean a salafi scholar is misguided just because he points them out. Please abstain from this type of argument, you don't judge a muhaddith by his reclassification, you judge them based on whether they follow the proper usool or not. And if you have no knowledge on usool, you have no right to criticize someone who spend years studying the usool.Btw, can you please PM me the hadeeth (don't write it in public, lest others be misled). Backbiting is haraam. But it's permissible in case of exposing a deviant and to prevent laymen from being misled by such an individual, like how scholars have backbitten against Ibn Arabi since he made up enormous false hadeeth- this is practice is recognized the by the salaaf-as-saliheen  too.",Requaza11,1497892688,t3_6i6d1m,t1_dj436zx,6,0,dj43rp8,islam,12,0.5

"Additionally, from another post in this thread which I just made, I realize I didn't address how the media plays into this all, so here is that text: Milo got pressed and cut off a lot in the original stream as well as his interview on Joe Rogan, and presenting that out of context, and worse, editing certain things together....This has been a problem with journalism for a while.  Hostile interviewers can get just about anyone to short circuit or say some weird shit and then present said shit out of context of not only the couple surrounding sentences but what the whole conversation is about.They did it to PewDiePie, they do it constantly with Trump, and they're doing it now with Milo.The only way this is somewhat different, Milo made the mistake of thinking he was speaking with rational people that would hear him out and try to understand the comments, not just get triggered at a turn of phrase, cut him off and proceed to go on a tirade.  The difference here is ""journalists"" (read: freelance editorial bloggers) didn't have to do the leg-work.  Chatting online can be a bitch, especially with many people all trying to talk at once.  There's a whole realm of information at how easy it is to discombobulate people by giving them audio input at the same time that they're trying to talk.On both sides of today's political debate there are more and more people that pull this shit instead of honestly listening and it's just getting worse and worse as people file into their echo chambers and come to the Belief^^^TM that they're correct in every thing.  It is parallel to fundamental religious zealotry and is incredibly cumbersome to deal with even when people are able to politely take turns(such as posting to reddit where you can't be interrupted).In a shorter quote:  It's not just about ethics in journalism, but degraded ethics over-all.

"u/_shulgin and u/The_Blog, I'll reply to you, too here.First, there are two kinds of shaving. One is legal, the other is not.1) Legal way - They will shave just the handle of the bat down to as thin as possible (while still being able to swing it with force, obviously). The effect this has is sort of weird, but preferable to a lot of hitters (I was terrible at hitting but had many friends/co-workers that did this). It has an effect of increasing the 'counterweight' of the bat as it goes through the zone. With the top end being heavier (duh), when you swing through with a very thin handle, combined with extremely strong wrist and forearm strength, it helps them ""whip"" the bat through the zone faster. It also makes the bats break much easier if they catch the ball in the wrong spot. They will use a tool called a ""spoke shave,"" and it looks like a planer blade that they will make up and down motions on the wood to get it nice and thin.2) Illegal - Shaving your bat in an illegal way is the process of taking the cap off the bat and shaving the inner walls of the bat itself. What this does is two things - 1) it makes the weight of the bat lighter overall, which increases swing speed, and 2) it increases the trampoline effect off the bat. These bats are also more prone to breaking. ETA: The illegal way to shave a bat is done on aluminum bats, as evidenced in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek9FLR7KJLcSource - former professional baseball player",ne1seenmykeys,1500610902,t3_6ojfca,t1_dkiaym6,18,0,dkibhdq,sports,872,0.020642201834862383

"How then, are you defining religion?  Is buddhism a religion?  What about Taoism?  What about Satanism (as in The Satanic Temple)?  I think that your OP is a simplification of what actually happens.   While humans have the capacity for rational thinking and logic, it is not something that naturally happens, and then is blocked in some way by religion. Logic is a system of thinking that must be taught, and as such most people do not have the skills to apply it in a complete fashion to the way they see the world.  Even many atheists that I know did not come to their belief system through logic; instead they arrived at the idea that there is no god because of their negative experiences with religion.  This is not a rational thought process, it is an emotional process.  Sure, they may have used logic in part of their process, but it is not the driving force. Humans are an amalgum of beliefs and systems that are contradictory, because it is not the general nature of our species to build a belief system from the ground up.  What happens is that when we experience something in the world, we have a reaction to it, either positive or negative, and then we develop ideas around it.   Some people will then create a system of belief based around those experiences and ideas.  The dangerous thing about many religions is that they promote the idea that morality comes from an external source, and if you don't believe in or obey that external source, you will behave in an immoral fashion.    This relinquishes ultimate control over our behavior from ourselves to an external source, and that leads to a lot of problems.",mikkylock,1486391923,t3_5sdcm9,t1_dde8ow0,4,0,ddeeuew,changemyview,113,0.035398230088495575

"Well, acknowledging that I speak for myself and not only feminists, here is my opinion given the context of this post as well as your previous one on r/AskFeminists. I asked you on what you were requesting feedback because you hadn't clarified it in this post or your other one. However, I believe that your summary of the responses you received from the Ask Feminist post is not accurate, and thus I was seeking to understand in your own words your reasoning behind turning to this sub to repeat the question. It seems clear to me that you didn't get the response you were looking for, and whether or not it's because you disagreed with or were simply unsatisfied with the ones you did is up to interpretation.That said, speaking solely for myself, my opinion of the overall situation you described is pretty much the same as u/GermanDeath-Reggae replied. I'm in the US, but have travelled extensively in Europe, and gone to clubs around the world. The concept that dance clubs are based on profit (from both men and women attending) certainly shouldn't be novel to you, and given that you don't mind the sexualized nature of clubs personally, I would hazard to guess that your question is more accurately seeking an answer of whether or not feminists, or feminism, find a double standard in their treatment of customers.That's a tall order, as the policies and patronage of clubs differ from one to another, and the attitudes associated with handling unwanted sexual advances is contingent upon the views and values of both the visitors and the club's owners.To address your other questions:1) I don't have nearly enough information to decide whether or not the men who you've seen laughed at for reporting sexual advances or harassment was acceptable or appropriate. At face value, of course it's not okay for people to be laughed at when they're expressing their mistreatment. 2) If by ""these things"" you mean the sexualized nature of most dance clubs, then yes I definitely can call it commonplace. If you mean specifically men being victimized by women, no, it is not something my male friends have complained about, nor was this a common issue when I worked in bars and clubs.3) When it comes down to it, sexual harassment overall is underreported, period. However, women face sexual harassment and victimization more frequently than men, but that isn't to say that men don't face it at all. Thus, even if you personally aren't bothered by the instances in which a woman gropes you at a club, you are seemingly bothered by the idea that other men are - and believe the treatment they receive for reporting it is inadequate or wrong, hence your post. When the same Redditor as above responded to your comment ""I see women harassing men more than I see men harassing women in my personal experience"" by pointing out that is *your* experience and that ""Just about every woman would disagree with you"", they were attempting I believe to clarify to you that your experiences are but one anecdote in a sea of the exact complaint many women report.My suggestion to you, then, is to question what it is exactly that bothers you so much about this perceived injustice...Namely, if the experience of observing reported harassment being laughed at, dismissed or downright ignored troubles you from the male's perspective, are you equally if not more so troubled by the same issue being faced by women when they report harassment experienced in non-sexualized settings? For example, a woman reporting a man intentionally grazing her thigh on the subway or a woman reporting a group of men explicitly cat-calling her on the street?If you remain more bothered by the plight of the men in the club, then there's more at stake here.",Harmanious,1499736488,t3_6mel53,t1_dk1sl5y,4,0,dk1xpdl,Feminism,4,1.0

"Even if you support marijuana legalization, you cannot disapprove of Trump's administration enforcing federal marijuana laws and be intellectually consistent.  If states can't ignore immigration laws they do not agree with, they also cannot ignore drug laws they don't agree with.Ignoring enforcement also allows Congress to ignore the issue and not take a stand on legalization.  Simply ignore the law, but refuse to change it, so you can play both sides.  If it finally gets enforced, Congressmen in legal states will be forced to take a stand and push for Federal legalization, or else face the electoral ramifications from their constituents. The President's job, as chief executive, is to enforce the law.  Not ignore laws he doesn't like.

"As the war winds down and negotiations begin I think the US would be prudent to take a step back in a passive arbitration role. Assad is no fan of Erdogan and that is the biggest threat to Kurdish autonomy at the moment. I'm sure Assad will require a legal pledge of allegiance to the Syrian state, structured taxation, and some level of central government in Kurdish regions. Still, I think the US enforcing a NFZ does more to worsen Turkey's perception of a Kurdish threat on their border than it does to protect them from a war weary Assad who -- for now -- lacks Russian support to contest it.I'm not saying you're wrong. Maybe Assad has no intention whatsoever to let Kurds govern the cantons. It's not as if their governing will be perfect either. In all likelihood Putin (or the US) doesn't care too much about the Syrian Kurds other than using them as a PR bonus and the fact that a neutral stance ends the war in their favor much sooner. In 2 years we might have a President who is completely unwilling to follow through on any policy created now.

"I'm not MGTOW as far as most here are, I more fell into it... Quick story I guess.Grew up atheist, so didn't value virginity such as you, however was raised almost entirely by my mother... One because of the domineering ""Gynocentric"" attitude of her family and society and also as a consequence of my father being raised in a genuinely abusive and ""too much"" paternalistic household (his father, my grandfather was a religious extremist to put it bluntly.) ... So, while we differ on the sex aspect there's a lot of overlap of being blue pilled as it were.  Always wanted to find both sex if available but ultimately seeking a partner, an equal of sorts, with which to go through life....Cue many instances of confusion when ""making love"" and being accused of being a woman or a girl in terms of my temperament in bed, being fobbed off by legendarily promiscuous women who could smell the beta a mile away, I actually turned down a girl for sex one day after a massive effort to romance her... dinner, movie, went home and gave her a full body massage with oil, getting a bit more promiscuous as it went on... But ultimately something about it in the end just turned me off.  At the time I felt like it was because I'd put so much effort into ""changing her mind"" to have sex... But in time I think I more objected to.... Well, just how ridiculous an effort was required, given this girl was legit into me, and I knew had fantasized\liked me for years.  She ran off with a Chad 14 years her senior about a year later (well after our semi relationship ended.) ...Was with a very religious Baptist girl for a few years, she left to make a long story short because I couldn't read her mind and had my own problems which she couldnt\wouldnt help with.... Which wasn't much of an ask given the supports I had provided her in similar regards (emotional support.) ... There was zero sex for that relationship, have it on good authority she banged the guy she left me for on very short order...So while I am not MGTOW because I find it difficult to accept that I cannot find a reliable partner, I truly believe sex is simply a game, to most people.  A biological imperative for both sexes but one which is used as a motivational and demotivational bludgeon with which to manipulate individuals...So the way to view sex?  It's not a goal.  You cant let it be a goal which drives your actions.... Which is I think the core of the admirable and empowering aspect of MGTOW I am attracted to philosophically.Your line of inquiry makes me suspect you are still highly.... Motivated, pulled, corralled, by sexual urges... Which is fine, and I think that at certain stages of life everyone is doomed to be so... But it can be mitigated a bit by recognizing that it is just a game, and whether openly or not viewed as a ""reward"" by those given the role of selector, not a mutually gratifying activity...So what's the solution, in that paradigm?  Forget about it, largely.  Don't go into situations with it as an end goal, and if it comes up as an opportunity or a potentiality with some girl I'd just be honest about it ""happy to be single."" ""Not interested in relationships, life is great"" that kind of thing.   Keep your frame positive, but self focused, you don't need shit.  Basically a bit of a mishmash between a Chad, Red pill, and PUA mentality. Not being antagonistic or manipulative about it, not playing the game, just being honest and confident that you don't need to or want to play it... And truly internalizing that frame, because when (and most likely when, this is a pretty much guaranteed mindset to get you some tail at some point...) When it gets down to brass tacks if you havent internalized it down to just mutual gratification, and simply personal gratification if there is no active communication or interplay, you will find yourself slipping into the subservient\beta etc etc mindset, and the things you say and do will likely make you unattractive...Basically do you... Sex at one point was likely more powerful and influential on behaviour by its releasing of hormones and chemicals to bond people together for child rearing, but the modern world has made it so easy and so ever presently tempting to break those bonds that they are nearly meaningless, and I think that goes for both genders.  Porn is a bit of a driver of that, but not the biggest one I would say, as it is also partly a response driven by the bigger cultural shift for men to self satisfy... So I say use it, although as anything in life recognize it as a tool, and any tool can harm you if overused or misused :PI'd be curious to know about those three relationships, how did the conversations about sex and marriage go after each refusal? What were their reasonings for not wanting marriage but to go ahead with sex? How were the relationships otherwise? Balance of emotional or physical inputs? They could have been trying to respark some dying feelings in themselves (bored) ... Be trying to... Well, subjugate you somewhat, for lack of a better word (obviously that could be unpacked) ... Or fundamentally not understand why their religion values chastity before a full commitment? Given the complexities there it's hard to pass judgement off, although I'm sure many here won't hesitate :) To distill back, what should you do regarding sex given your newly ""redpilled\mgtow"" awakening?   Exactly as the title says, Man, go your own way.  Your upbringing says to worship monogamy, fidelity, ""true"" love, Red pill says fuck it learn the game and abuse it as best you can, MGTOW says ""forget all that, don't play their game, make your own."" ... That doesn't mean don't walk on the field, just that you should ignore everyone playing soccer and just lay on the grass and enjoy the birds, just ignore and smile at the people who try to shame you or teach you how soccer works, just smile and nod and enjoy your own heaven on earth...

"The 15"" MBP does worse when that bug is in effect, but otherwise it's good. This will probably be fixed in the future, and therefore isn't going to be a problem a few years down the road.The 13"" tbMBP however suffers from a very small battery. That can't be fixed in a software update. The 13"" non-tbMBP has a bigger battery and a CPU that consumes significantly less power, hence it's better battery life. Unlike some redditors, I don't think that the touch bar itself is the issue here. The thing runs WatchOS and doesn't really do anything intensive, and one look at how much power the Apple Watch uses should tell you that it's not the touch bar causing issues. Instead, it's the spec differences.As for why Apple shipped the 13"" tbMBP with a too small battery to give decent lifetime with the specs (the 15"" is also affected by this, although not to the same extent) we don't know for sure, but rumors suggest that Apple were going to use a terraced battery like the one in the 12"" MB, but an issue came up and they chose to drop it as it wouldn't be ready for a holiday release if they didn't. The relatively huge amount of wasted space in the tbMBP's internals (very unusual for Apple hardware and also seems weird for a redesign that was about making a thinner model) seem to suggest this. The non-tbMBP isn't affected as it doesn't have similar amounts of wasted space inside.",m0rogfar,1484322935,t3_5nmjiu,t1_dcdjps4,2,0,dcdo55v,technology,176,0.011363636363636364

"Hi Sally!I'm a graduate of an accredited state university with degrees in physics and chemistry. Naturally, I work two jobs, delivering pizza during the day and washing dishes at night trying to make ends meet so that I can send my children to college.What I would like to ask you about is the importance of learning either CHINESE or RUSSIAN in the STEM field, since there are no jobs in STEM in any English speaking countries, other than, apparently, working for the government trying to get more people to study STEM!As far as ""teacher appreciation day,"" I would like to say to my former teachers who prevented me from transferring to the vocational stream that I would have a real job right now if I had studied something useful like plumbing or welding, and not science and literature. Ayn Rand was particularly helpful in deciding to never listen to another adult as long as I lived, and while I love physics and chemistry with all my heart, our society no longer values knowledge.",Ordinate1,1494374221,t3_6a4pi6,t3_6a4pi6,1,0,dhcpfmg,science,387,0.002583979328165375
"Because the investigation was still ongoing maybe? I'm pretty sure the police doesn't have a SOP for this kind of thing and would like to be just a liiiiitle prepared when going public. 3 days is well within reason seeing there were so many different reports. Calling it a cover up because of that is a way too far a reach for me to make, especially since this is more or less ""uncoverupable"". Two words: sample size and categories. They group rape with other sexual offences. The * in the report means that the number is unreliable (read: useless). Whoever is trying to tell you the number is 0, citing that report, is not letting you know the whole picture. Also think about it. In the US, during 5 years, not a single black woman was raped by a white man? don't you think that's just a little fishy? Your BS detector should be blinking red when hearing stuff like this. Why? Have the reports been scapped totally? Sure you are, its being discussed all the time, and its a huge problem. That number says nothing on its own (source anyway, and no numbers thats calculated from the DoJ reports with *'s).Either way, lets be honest, blacks are more likely to commit a crime, but as you say, its not because of a genetic predisposition. Its more to do with culture, and very much to do with a bad culture being propagated in ghettos, with crime and violence being glorified. I get that, and I think few people would disagree.But reading your post you seem to be contradicting yourself quite a lot of times. You speak of the cause for the increased violence as not being a genetic predisposition. This means that the fact that the color of your skin is black has nothing to do with your predisposition to crime, and so far we are in agreement, yet you insist of bringing color into the equation. What would make sense to talk about is the culture, how it got there, what's driving it now and what to do about it in the future. That discussion will lead somewhere. A discussion of the color of someone’s skin will not yield any solutions, as thats not where the problem lies.",slashfromgunsnroses,1487020786,t3_5tmrh0,t1_ddnypg3,2,0,ddpcn3g,AskThe_Donald,90,0.022222222222222227

"When we went into the Middle East, we had no interest in ""making allies out of enemies"" our only objective was to kill terrorists. The Bush administration was very clear that they had no interest in nation building and that this was definitely not a counterinsurgency.US soldiers stayed in walled compounds and went out solely to hunt down terrorists. If they got a tip, they'd kick in the door like a SWAT team. This strategy resulted in Al Qaeda becoming much stronger. Their presence in Iraq was minimal to nonexistent until the US implemented this strategy.Eventually, we realized that we'd made a critical mistake. *In order to defeat the enemy, we needed to make people our allies.*  Every counterinsurgency is like that. That's the whole reason that we switched over - that's what the troop surge was about. It took some trial and error before we really got a handle on what we were doing, and unfortunately by the time it started working it was too little too late (counterinsurgencies are very difficult even when you do know what you're doing).The military has picked up on the things I'm saying (or rather I picked it up from them), it's just that most people haven't studied it and weren't directly involved so the general public still has the same backwards ideas they had before.

"I went on a semester abroad in second year and in the program there were only 2 guys including me and 18 girls. The other guy was what Mystery would call an Average Frustrated Chump but, to be honest here, so was I. I knew of the red pill's existence but I was still a virgin who didn't lift.Anyway, I did end up losing my virginity and then some (logistics were just phenomenal) and as OP said, a lot of the girls were in relationships and every single one cheated (one of them with me). I was very bitter that only one cheated with me because I had my eye on two others as well. Here's the thing though: I recently dated a girl who got a job across the ocean for six weeks and I had to decide if we were going long-distance or bust. Thanks to the red pill awakening I'd had in second year, the choice was a very obvious one: I had to break up with her. And I did.

"I think we just view assimilation differently. I'm not interested in being thought police on what people believe nor am I interested in guessing what someone believes. Someone can believe that apostates should be killed but as long as they don't act on that belief it doesn't matter to me.  Where you care what they believe, I only care how they act. There are plenty of people in my country that believe things I find reprehensible but that's their right. The Sharia patrol is an interesting problem, if they are just talking then they can do what they want but if they are restricting other people they should be punished. The German case is just people telling other people what to do which is common here in the US for Christian people to stand outside sporting events and yell into megaphones that non believers are going to hell. Again it's their right to yell, I don't have to listen. The Copenhagen group again was harassing patrons, if they did it on private property they deserve to be tossed and if they vandalized then they're criminals, but it sounds like their just a gang with religious pretenses. Shop owners are accosted by gangs for money with different motives but we shouldn't treat it any differently than a normal gang to be stamped out by the police. The final gang committed violence and was arrested for it. Again people commit crimes, they get punished. I'm not in the business of assuming people's actions before they commit a crime.

"The article I linked references NASA and the Pentagon, I'm not sure what other sources you would want.Regardless, I'm not asserting that this is the #1 most dangerous thing in climate change.

"Useless and counterproductive. Censorship does not erase opinions, and at times can even lend them a martyred righteousness and legitimacy among adherents and can even aid them in their outreach. If leftists actually care about changing the world and combating regressive positions they need to use their brains to actually do so. Demanding silence because you don't agree with someone is not effective. It's an exercise in ego, not activism.If there is a position one disagrees with, and you actually care about halting the spread of that idea, then you have to do the hard work of convincing people why your position is better than theirs. Silencing does not accomplish this, and really only displays to people that you lack the ability to prove your position better through logical debate. And if you actually care about eradicating that position, then you need to figure out why people are being led to that position in the first place. Just throwing a temper tantrum and saying 'everyone's a racist bigot!' isn't a way to effect social change. Unless you think people are born racist, then it's your job to figure out the how and why people are manipulated into being so, and fix that. There's this irrational idealism where people just don't even want to think about ugly topics, so it comforts them to just point fingers, declare themselves superior, and stick their head in the sand. Well that's fine if personal mental comfort is your top priority, but if you actually want to rid the world of those ugly things IRL then you need to confront the reality of them. I think this lack of interest in basic human empathy is one of the major failings of the left (I mean the 'real left', not even getting into the liberals who call themselves left but themselves support literal fascists like obama) - that there is no attempt to, for lack of a better phrase, 'be the bigger person', to go to the followers of your opposing ideology, and figure out how they are being manipulated to support it. Undoubtedly they have many valid positions that are being ignored by 'the left' and being exploited by the right, and then tied into many other invalid positions in creation of this package deal we have with all or none left and right 'camps'. If the left does not reach out to them on those valid positions and say we hear you and we want to fix these too and here is the real problem, then the right wing will pretend to hear them, and then manipulate them for it. As one example, we could look at the (central/south american) immigration crisis. This was created by a democratic president for the benefit of big business, particularly the agriculture, incarceration, and war industries (the border is essentially a permanent war zone with all the accompanying weaponry and equipment). It is not an intractable problem. It is an intentionally created (and intentionally sustained) booming business model. The common people on the right who are rightfully worried about their own deteriorating economic well-being are told by republicans that immigrants are to blame. Racism against immigrants is fostered. What do liberals/democrats do in return? They just say '\*gasp\* I am shocked, you are such a deplorable racist'. They never tell the people on the right, hey, you're being misled, the immigrants aren't to blame, here let us explain to you who is really to blame... because they would have to point the finger at their own party. And so democrats in fact depend on that racism existing *just as much* as republicans do. It gives them the empty position of just getting in a huff and 'being against it'. While they actually aren't because they have no interest in actually solving the problem. The opposition on the political level is scripted and non-existent. But they foment real opposition among the people by playing their fictional roles. If leftists want to fix that opposition among the people they need to recognize who's being played and for what reason are they susceptible, and then address that. I think some have a very fragile sense of their own morality and see relating to those across the aisle as somehow catering to or validating bigotry. But if a person can't handle the reality of how and why the people are propped up against each other for the benefit of the elites, then I don't see what business that person has being a leftist as it seems they'd rather live in a fantasy land rather than actually tackle those distressing divisions.",qwertypoiuytre,1498682148,t3_6jz1dn,t3_6jz1dn,2,0,djj02ij,GenderCritical,15,0.13333333333333333

HOWWWWWWWWWWW?!!?!?!??!!??!""I'll give her some dignity by ignoring that she uses the Pissgate dossier (the dossier that couldn't even get basic information on Russian cities correct, and claimed Trump was in Russia while news reports had him in Florida, and also had gems like him shouting that he was calling a shit he had Barack Obama and he just shouted randomly ""I HATE BLACK PEOPLE""), and focus on her story.It starts off with Russia is corrupt... but the crux of this story revolves around a guy who lost the most expensive divorce ever... in Russia (kinda flakey corruption you have there, Vladdy)... and she outright says he's looking to throw money anywhere, so her proof is that Trump bought a Florida mansion 2 years prior (I mean, we accuse him of thinking ahead too, but damn), and Wilbur Ross was the largest stakeholder of Deutchbank... which Trump was trying to sue (let's just leave that as a ""connection"", I guess)... so... he just told Trump about this guy... (or... did Ross connect HIM to Trump... or...?) and Fert King (shorthanding his name) bought a property Trump had for a large amount of money... which is what Maddow says this guy is trying to do in general (which would've been 5 times the amount of Trump's lawsuit if Trump won. I know lawyers are expensive and all, but fuck), and then tries to use the fact that this guy never went into the mansion as... something, I guess (sellers don't care how you use the product as long as the money's good)... and... then... idunno...Logically speaking, literally everything stopped right there. She doesn't follow that up with anything other than that guy bought a house and Wilbur Ross was a stakeholder in the bank he was a ranking member of.So, this guy loses a court case, buys a house to get out of paying his ex wife, and everything else surrounding that is loose as fuck and then she discredits everything she says by using the Pissgate dossier.Classic Maddow.

People are so eager to blame Clinton and call her a terrible candidate, but how do you even campaign against someone who cannot be killed off? Dukakis rode in a tank and ended up losing in a landslide. Trump riding around in a tank seems almost normal and wholesome compared to everything else. At some point people have to recognize that they played by a very different set of rules, and the media and public in general were happy to put those rules in place. Hillary Clinton *gave speeches as a private citizen*, and it dogged her campaign for months.

Yes its not a genuine shot of the protest no they are probably not paid actor. Unless u can prove it?

"That Sargon video is crap because like in most of his videos he twists people's words around and then attacks that point instead.Like starting around 11:23 when Franchesca is explaining White Fragility she describes it as ""the discomfort **some** white people have towards talking about racism"". Sargon's response is that she is racist for talking about how ""white people are inferior and have an inherent fragility about them."" She never said nor implied any of those things! Also she mentions that the term was coined by ""Dr. Robin DiAngelo a white Critical Racial and Social Justice Scholar"", meaning that she is white and studies critical race theory and social justice. I'm guessing she mentions that Dr. DiAngelo is white to comfort people (like Sargon here) that this term is from a white lady and the mean ol' POC aren't just picking on white people.

"Revenue should not be lowered but Medicare and social security should be cut. They are no longer revenue neutral and the projections show they are going to take up an increasing percentage of our budget. It's now a form of welfare because recipients get more than they pay in.  We need to reduce the deficit by cutting spending including mandatory spendibg. Taxes on the top should be reduced (in high tax states 57% of every dollar earnt above 400000 goes to the government if you include state and local taxes) by lowering the federal top tax marginal rate from 39.6% to 35% but the boundary at which it starts should be reduced to $200000. This will increase revenues and reduce income inequality as taxes have been raised for those who make over $200000. Furthermore, capital gains tax should be increased which would further reduce income inequality. Additionally, a VAT should be implemented instead of the corporate tax (Ryan is implementing a border adjusted tax which is essentially a VAT) because it's far more efficient and produces lots more revenue.

I can definitely agree with this. I'm 5'9 without shoes on so I'm not the tallest guy in the world. But when it comes to confrontation I love it. It's one of the best skills you can have and it gets shit done. That being said speaking to my wife I asked her what she loves about me and why she didn't ever get with the friend that introduced us (guy was hovering over  her for years. He was actually taller than me and pretty built) and she said he wasn't attractive in her eyes at all. I definitely recognize when a guy can definitely get laid so I asked her to elaborate. Guess what she said next. He didn't ever ask her out. Never escalated physically. Never tried to talk dirty and was VERY timid. He was athletic but awkward as all hell. He was also a mama's boy. She has an attitude. Lots of it. Loves talking shit and has a great sense of humor. He was always nervous around her and it just hurt to watch. Never be afraid to pull to trigger guys. I'd rather watch my friends fail 100 times before watching them not even try. Failure is your friend and learn from any mistakes you make. There are billions of people in the world and you  will never get to see a fraction of that.

"This is an absolutely disgusting post, and shows the toxic mentality that's driving me away from this sub. I've been a part of this sub for several years now, and I've had some outstanding discussions with many of you, both current and past users. It was always a good place to come for a roundup of any news and to discuss with people passionate about this sport and mostly knowledgeable about soccer as well. You don't often get that in an online community. The biggest thing that /r/soccer used to be compared to most social media &amp; forums, was inclusive &amp; respectful of all soccer fans - those from Europe &amp; those from America, those who became fans in the 70s and those who became fans after the last World Cup. One of the only rules, one that everyone enforced as a community &amp; abided by, was essentially ""don't be an asshole"". Everybody respect everybody's opinion, disagree but respect. That's just no longer the case anymore. And this isn't about anyone getting the downvote brigade because they're from America. There isn't any feeling of good humored banter anymore. It's gone to a very anti-foreigner, xenophobic atmosphere, particularly towards Americans - myself included, but many others as well. Downvotes don't really matter, but the amount of ""most American thing I've heard today"" and the like are just beyond silly ignorance. Many of the good-natured fun people have gone, but many of you are still here, yet you do absolutely nothing to combat this, not like you used to anytime someone was being a dick for no warranted reason. Your mods may not have the role of policemen, but they are certainly guilty of standing by and enabling this behavior just like everybody else. I guess at the end of the day, this sub is a microcosm of reddit as a whole. This isn't really a message ""fuck off"" to the people who are saying the anti-American bullshit, as much as it is a message to those of you who aren't to make it unwelcome, because at this point, Americans aren't welcome here. There's a mild tolerance for Americans, but as soon as opinions disagree, the anti-American ignorance flows freely and is clearly the primary point in the counter-argument of the American commentor. How did this subreddit become so exclusive, xenophobic, even apologetic for anti-Americanism &amp; more against those offended by it, etc.? This just doesn't seem like a place for me. Downvote away. Fill the comments with more ""chill out"", ""why are you offended by anti-Americanism?"". This is purely a message to the community I used to enjoy to encourage those who feel the same way to either do something or just go somewhere else, as I'm doing.

"Assuming Trump is guilty of something under Bob Mueller's investigative purview. . .From a pure game theory perspective, Trump's smartest play would be to fire and replace Rosenstein this afternoon and order new DAG (Dana Boente) to immediately terminate special counsel Mueller.  When Boente refuses, Trump will terminate him immediately and replace with a Trump loyalist who will terminate the special counsel—a lá Robert Bork.Again, assuming Trump knows he's guilty of something under Mueller's investigative purview, there's little reason to let DoJ-led investigations continue, given that Congress isn't particularly likely to appoint an independent counsel while under GOP control.  And, even if they do, it will be someone who is more GOP-friendly, and much less rigorous and resourced than Mueller—and the focus will be circumscribed to Russia.  Mueller currently has expansive purview, including over domestic biz dealings.It'll be politically painful to do a Friday-night massacre, but it will defer or eliminate a shitload of legal risk, if you start from assumption that Trump has committed a discoverable felony of some stripe in the past decade.

"I never said that fake news constitutes a story being an unfavorable one. Unfavorable stories for both candidates has and will continue to come out all the time. My point in calling it fake news is the point that a news corporation shouldn't claim to be bipartisan while being so obviously partisan. CNN clearly prefers a side and so does Fox News, except fox news doesn't sensationalize stories nearly as much as CNN does. Fox still sensationalizes stories, don't get me wrong, but not nearly as much as CNN. When CNN basically makes every single thing Trump does sound like it could lead to impeachment, that is one of the problems that I am talking about. I won't get into CNN's intentionally misleading editing of multiple videos (the recent handshake video being an example) because that is a topic for another day. In case you don't know, CNN essentially said that a first lady intentionally didn't shake Trump's hand when meeting him. Then they proceeded to edit out the part where she clearly shakes his hand, she just shakes Melania's hand first (which is where they cut it).",Pappaman1,1499879770,t3_6mrcd5,t1_dk4jj4j,2,0,dk4llhl,AskThe_Donald,88,0.022727272727272728

"Okay it must have been [one in a pretty small percentage of economists](http://www.aei.org/publication/economists-and-the-universal-basic-income-the-details-matter-a-lot/). Economists tend to be fairly a political but they may differ slightly in interpretations of data. Thats a perfectly valid view, but you also have said you aren't an expert in the field. I am not either but I do feel I have a fairly good understanding of some of the basic ideas and principals. Thats one of the reasons I have tended to go with the majority analysis. That doesn't mean its a great analysis. Being honest here it seems like a single variable analysis of a complex multivariable problem. Do you think that economics are the only reason that people decide to get married or not? How about incarceration rates since the war on drugs started? How about the Womens lib movement? The list goes on and on. Theres actually quite a bit of research done on the topic. To quote the [largest study done](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1558786?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents) ""I find that a regime of lower benefits and stronger work incentives encourages married aid recipients to stay married, but has little effect on the probability that single-parent aid recipients marry."" Okay good, because it seems around 1% of that 35% goes to that. Now to add on to that, You do realize that UBI is primarily theorized as a way to deal with high levels of unemployment right? How common are fraudulent claims? Instead it will create more jobs in paying out and keeping track of the constant movements of, and lives and deaths of the public. And still making sure no fraud is taking place. I mean you are talking about making a radically more complex and comprehensive bureaucratic system that will have to take its place. Your moving from a system that serves a select few to one that serves the whole populace now. That increases chance of fraud many times over. Okay just looking into it slightly that seems like the reverse of the problem at hand. Its more that people who work limited hours and qualify for benefits do so because they work the limited hours, not that they can only work the hours because of the benefits. Okay the only benefit I found that applies to is ESA which is specifically for people that can't work for some reason or another and have fulfilled a pretty extensive set of requirements for why they can't and if they qualify.",Ardonpitt,1498751781,t3_6k7h5m,t1_djk5nd4,3,0,djk89e4,changemyview,41,0.07317073170731707

I'll link the short one.Related - FBI runs 21 child porn sites - https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5cfj3h/fbi_operated_23_torhidden_child_porn_sites/But I'll tell you what's happening in plain English. FBI is Political Police. Their job is to entrap politicians and leverage later. Old leaders, Romans, worshiped the Sun God, the two-heads of coin, and essentially Satanism. Thus the Bible was a manual to defeating Rome. Moving on...The Podestas are sick ass fuck. Tony Podesta is on Saudi payroll, literally. He works for Saudi Arabia and John, works for Hillary. Tony &amp; John bare a striking resemblance to the kidnappers of a little girl ~20 years ago. Saudi Arabia has been known to have underage sex with girls. Maria is a professed Satanist.Hillary's charity donated $10,000 to Maria's Satanism. Maria has a collection of cannibal art work and piles of skulls and bones, thousands of murdered animals for art.Maria invites John, Tony, &amp; Miss Tony over for Spirit Cooking. Spirit Cooking is a the letting of blood. Maria often writes messages in blood accompanied by 666 and pentagrams and so on, as well as disembodied heads and pictures of human flesh up for consumption. Tony Podesta has a statute of a Jeffrey Dohmer's (cannibal) dinner (thin human male) in a particularly striking pose as a type of chandelier.**Spirit Cooking is also fresh cum mixed with fresh breast milk. Maria instructs this via images to podesta written in blood.**Almost done....Big - Little is a child sex game. Besta (Beast) Pizza's logo appears on the FBI website under 'child sex logos' and is owned by one of four US judges for Human Trafficking (slogan : Sticky as a long, slow summer fuck - 10,000') appointed by Obama. Their neighbor is Comet Ping Pong &amp; Pizza.Comet has the Cresent Moon &amp; Star as their logo. In addition their instagram consist primarily of nude bodies (censored with pizza), gay men, &amp; a 'torture chamber'. The related instagrams of the owners show children taped and an 'odd amount of children', and Tony Podestas home. Comet Pizza had a surly woman discussing the killing of her child, or desire to, and discribes a baby as a thing to throw away perform.That said Comet Pizza advertises as 'up for anything' &amp; able to provide accommodations for adults or children. :)Lastly Comet Pizza owner is good friends with the Podestas and Clinton holds fundraisers there (David Brock, CTR, fucked Comet Pizza owner).**Tony gets an email.**The lady says you left your handkerchief ""it has a map on it - seems Pizza-related?""Handkerchief also appears on the FBI website, and a black and white handkerchief such as this represents Child Bondage according to the FBI. A Pizza related map???Per FBI, young girls are referred to as cheese pizza &amp; young boys as pasta. The Podesta talk about eating cheese pizza &amp; pasta... a lot. It's always a 'pizza party' at Comet Pizza, sometimes cheese, sometimes pasta. Comet Pizza has a private login as well, unconnected with ordering pizza.Tony Podesta keeps art of a man known for painting provocative babies, and describes 'loving his work'. Maria has similar art work, preferred by John. Epstein is a child sex trafficker and writes to Bill (I think) 'I got a pool ready for you with (3 girl names) ages 14, 11, and almost 7. You should have fun!' Lastly Comet Pizza owner is listed as one of the most power people in Washington. Odd...Oh and Maria carved a pentagram over her uterus and Podesta has a HUGE number of scars on his fingers.**tl/dr** : US Judge &amp; Tony P. appear in connection with Child Sex Trafficking as described by the FBI &amp; the Podestas regularly participate in Satanic cannibalism, and the Clinton's &amp; FBI may be involved the coverup - and Comet Pizza is a gay sex joint with an odd amount of children &amp; Besta Pizza logo appears on the FBI website under Pedophile symbols.

"I mean, I guess that's technically true, since you can't for a matter of fact prove that any old historical figure actually existed.  And I guess the second point is also technically true.  Even though the New Testament was written by 8 or 9 different writers, and was accepted by the converted Jews, there's a chance that everyone could have been colluding somehow.

Anyone who disagrees with that (Read: Catholics) by definition are not fundamentalists. I apologize, because I really don't understand if this statement is trying to make a point of some kind. I know that I'm right because I follow the Bible and not the Church.  That is irrelevant, because the point I was trying to make was not that I am right and they are wrong, but that one of OP's complaints was that he thinks religion is used to manipulate fear, and Fundamentalist Christianity doesn't manipulate fear, because to be a Fundamentalist Christian does not require anything from the Christian but belief.",yodathegiant,1491636246,t3_63wsac,t1_dfyzox2,1,0,dfzndje,atheism,27,0.037037037037037035

Start slow, for the first 3 months, just eat EVERY meal (healthy ones), add moderate exercises, whatever you are comfortable with. See how that goes.Once you have done that, you have not triggered any kind of overeating/undereating, start watching your calories (not macros) for the next 3 months and increase your excercise intensity.After that you can start IIFYM.

"Trump is/was a business man, I'm sure he has relations all over the world. In fact, I know he does. What I'm talking about here was Trump-Putin-Russia-meddling, which was created with the DNCLeaks from Wikileaks. This was started the same day that Guccifer 2.0 appeared. June 14, 2016. That day he released 3 documents that were created 15 minutes prior to him stealing them, they were all created by the same person, Warren Flood. In the exact same documents released by Wikileaks a few weeks later, those documents showed up not being edited by Warren Flood, but by their actual creators, Lauren Dillon and Tony Carrk.  Someone operating under the same computer under the name Warren Flood, used what is likely to have been a Russian template document used - and that content from original documents was copied and pasted into the template and the results were saved as a new file, which is why the discrepancy occurred.   The hacked files that we were privy to were leaked in June of 2016. The dates even back that up. The allegation of Trump Russia started in June-2016.

"Claim: Women can lead men in obligatory prayer (no body is arguing whether from the back or front or basement or roof or mars or whatever)Traditionalists: Absolutely not allowed because the evidence used is Umm Waraqa hadith which they believe is weak and has issues.Rationalists: Allowed because Umm Waraqa hadith which is narrated via multiple chains is hasn or better. As evidence they cite that some famous traditionalists held view that women can lead men in obligatory prayer. That some traditionalists hold Umm Waraqa hadith as hasn. That there are multiple narrations of this hadith and the traditionalists attack only the weakest ones and leave the stronger narrations alone. Dr. Brown has an excellent expose on this in his book, Misquoting Mohammed.Thats the tldr; and feel free to disagree. Also, read Dr. Brown's piece on this. I can buy the book for you if you dont have the means. I have not found any thought out response to his expose. All I read are bits and pieces of this and that.Again, I have yet to even link to a source that questions the validity of that hadith. I never questioned the validity of it either. So why are you bringing that up? What I do have to say is that even that hadith makes no mention of Umm Waraqa leading men in prayer (ad-Daraqutni says that she was provided a man to call the adhan and the iqamah but she would then lead only women in prayer; this is one of the foundational proofs for women being allowed to lead prayer in women-only jama'ahs in the Hanbali and Shafi'i mahdhahib).Also, as I mentioned, none of the scholars you've mentioned have anything of evidence with regards to their reasoning. **There's no evidence they even referenced the narration from Umm Waraqa RA**. On top of that, there's no authentic, unbroken chain to those scholars themselves so we don't even have sufficient proof to say that what is being attributed to those scholars was actually their opinion. We don't know why at-Tabari is credited as being pro-women imam in a mixed congregation, for example. That's not how ""difference of opinion"" works in Islam otherwise you can then claim there's no such thing as consensus. In Islam, the vast majority of scholars and historians know that Aisha RA was 6 at marriage and 9 at consummation. Even the link you posted (from Ahmadiyyas, no less) is compounding errors by using various sources and then deriving a numerical value. They even disregard sahih narrations that place her age at 6 at marriage. As I said, even Jonathan Brown agrees that any evidence to the contrary is not conclusive at all. There's a difference between a scholar and a layperson and that is of knowledge. You don't go to a doctor and then lecture him on what the best antibiotic to prescribe is. Similarly, you don't go to a Mufti and tell him he's wrong unless you've done the work to attain a similar level of knowledge. I'm not even talking about individual scholars, but entire madhahib, which includes hundreds of thousands of scholars over the ages agreeing on positions. It's the entire anti-climate change argument that you hear, where the opinion of the vast overwhelming majority of experts is rejected while the extreme minority is given precedence by climate change deniers. I'm not saying that words of the scholar is the ""word of God"" because yes, they are humans, but we know from hadith that we are to stick to the majority.The Prophet PBUH said:    These are all directives for the layperson as we don't have the required knowledge to hold differing opinions yet be able to defend our stances as being grounded in truth rather than our personal whims or extra-Islamic biases.And if you're saying that scholars have made Islam dogmatic, you don't have any real exposure to scholars. Dogma *is* part of Islam but it is only a part. You can't really have a religion without dogmatic truth since we believe in Allah, His messengers, and the Qur'an without question. Uh, that's not at all what I meant and I think it was pretty obvious. If Islam explicitly mentions something but Muslims aren't following it or if Muslims are adopting things as part of their religion when there's no religious basis, then there's room for change. For example, some Muslims who believe women should not be allowed to work are going against specific examples in the sunnah. On the other hand, there is no scriptural evidence of women leading men in obligatory prayers, especially unconditionally. The fact that Umm Waraqa had to be assigned a man to call the iqamah and the adhaan points to this clearly, as well as the fact that she was a hafidha and that this is only a singular event that has no equal in all the other accounts from the companions, not even accounting for the fact that the hadith makes no mention of her leading men but ""her household"". You'd have to jump to quite a lot of hoops to even get close to justifying women leading men in prayer from the Qur'an, Sunnah, and the early scholars.",UniquelyUnunique,1498345312,t3_6j2bh7,t1_djcuk8h,2,1,djcwmwp,islam,104,0.019230769230769232

"**NO.  DO NOT DO THIS!**  The area above the falls that feed the lake is a delicate wetland.  It has remained relatively undisturbed for decades, but in recent years, more people have been venturing up to the top of the falls, increasing the same effects as wading and swimming in the lake itself.Just stay out of the water, ok?  Go to the natural hot springs in Glenwood or to a state with a coastline if you want to swim.  Fuck, just find a different trail with a stream and use that to quench your foot thirst.Hanging Lake was formed by a section of the valley floor falling away and creating a bowl with a well-defined rim. Water that has picked up calcium flowing across limestone formations slows down as it crosses the rim, allowing some of the calcium to settle out along the edge and more of it to deposit at the bottom of the pool of water collecting below.  Over thousands of years, this process, which continues today, created a travertine, or depositional, lake.People wading or swimming in the lake disturb the mineral deposition process and also leave body oils and cosmetic preparations such as lotion and sunscreen in the water.  All of this interferes with cohesion of the mineral particles that give the water such a beautiful color.Swimming in it is like tossing pennies into the Yellowstone springs.  It fucks it up, and there's no way to fix it.  Ever.  Three years ago, annual visits to Hanging Lake were about 90,000 people.  Last summer there were more than 137,000 visitors.  So starting in 2018, there will be no more parking allowed in the lot.  If you want to see it, you will have to take a shuttle from Glenwood.  And only 65 visitors a day will be allowed. That's what happens when you wade in the water above Hanging Lake.",quit_complaining,1501768645,t3_6r6nfn,t1_dl3fm57,4,0,dl3xmds,EarthPorn,486,0.00823045267489712

The anarchists that ruined the Berkeley protests were also present at the women's march in DC, but they were either arrested the day before when they set crap on fire or they were just relatively few in number compared to the overwhelming numbers of peaceful white ladies.",suegenerous,1488754141,t3_5xnxu9,t1_dejt5xx,30,0,dejvni7,PoliticalDiscussion,247,0.1214574898785425

"Dude, i have to explain how paying taxes isnt like murdering someone? Seriously?Ok then....Murder. Lets start with that. Im no philosopher but i think we can come to a general agreement on a definition of a murder. Its when one person does something to another person (usually directly and with malicious intent but not every time) that causes them to cease being alive. (Can we please skip the quagmire of ethics about fighting in a war and just agree thats a good way to explain murder?)Murder is bad. If someone is trying to murder you and you have to kill them to defend yourself, that isnt bad. Murder is bad because you are ending the life of another person who does not want to die but keep on living. The reason for the murder isnt really relevant. Taxes. Taxes are when a governing body who looks after the well being of a whole society takes a small percentage of money to help protect the society and make sure they are able to keep doing so. Taxes are pretty automatic these days. Back in the day tax collectors had to go around and collect the taxes themselves.Its no surprise that people arent generally enthused about paying taxes. However, it is part of being a citizen. It is the social agreement that is the basis of government:I am a citizen of Country. Country's responsibilty at the most basic level is to protect Citizens and provide some basic order.In return for protection and order (to keep your neighbor from just killing you and taking your stuff with no consequences) I give a little bit of money (or could even be services) to Country.Now, murder is just the ending of another persons life. Taxes are social agreement between citizens and a ruling body to provide protection, order, and continuance for both parties. See the difference?No.Didnt think so.Lets break it down a little more.Im sure youre thinking i didnt mention anything about consent. That muder is like *stealing* another persons life just like government *steals* your money! Aha! Got me there!Lets pretend that there is no social agreement mentioned earlier to explain that Ever had your parents say to you, ""while youre under my roof you'll live by my rules"" Thats a very informal analogy. We live inthis country we have to follow its rules. However, we will negate this analogy because of its informality. Just wanted to throw it out there. Lets look at our government. We have representatives in the government. So they speak on our behalf. They represent us. We want them to vote on issues the way we would vote. So in essence, we are all part of the government. We are somewhat both parties in this, citizen and government.By electing a representative, we give consent to that representative to,well, represent us. They speak on our behalf. Our representatives consented to taxes so we have consented as well.But wait a minute, *I PERSONALLY* did not consent to that decision. Like you said, your representative may not always vote your way. So you can kick him out, just like you said. That is a consequence. You dont speak for my interests, you dont get to represent me anymore. You can always try to represent yourself. But then again, you have to be elected so, if your constituents dont elect you based on your views then you are basically stealing their representation without their consent if you pushed forward with your no taxes measure. But hey, you got what you wanted right? I am really tired of typing now. I could go on but please dont make me. I dont consent to that. But i hope i illustrsted that ending someones life against their will is very different from participating in a social agreement with your colleagues to protect each other.",screwstd,1491844462,t3_64bh9m,t1_dg2umh2,1,0,dg2wrvv,Libertarian,78,0.01282051282051282

"This is a hard one and the two of you may benefit from a sex counselor or a counselor in general. What she is doing to you can't feel good, and her reasons for doing so probably aren't healthy. I don't think it's about the sex for her and there's most likely a different issue with her that is manifesting in her emasculating you. There is no good reason to tell someone they're not at good as a toy is, or not to have patience enough to give them something they themselves seem to have plenty of. She may not want to change things but her pleasure is at your expense and you need to point that out to her. This isn't fine with you and it looks like she needs this to be told to her. I'm sorry that you're being pushed to the side in this way. One thing I do want to point out is that the sex may have gotten stagnant or some other way become an inconvenience to her. Libido waxes and wanes throughout the day for many people, so it very well could be that when your schedules coincide she may not be in the mood. In any case this is going to require a fairly strenuous conversation and honesty from everyone without finger pointing. She may point them at you so be prepared, but whatever happens try to be the bigger person. Tell her how you feel and that your needs aren't being met and that you miss her. Ask about why she seems to prefer the toys and try to get a real answer.

"I'm a social worker. Diversity is the cornerstone of our profession and I call bullshit on cultural appropriation.

While there, she got a weave. This is a loud, cheery, pasty white girl with blue eyes. Admittedly, the reaction between us (including me at the time) back in the stAtes was ""wtf is she doing??? That's so wrong and appropriating culture!!!!1!"" Except we found out later the women from the country were the ones who first suggested it and convinced her to do it. And even if someone doesn't suggest it, something doesn't ""belong"" to a certain group of people. If it's being used respectfully and with no foul intention, shut the fuck up and let people live. SJWs say let everyone do their own thing and be happy and then get fucking pissed when someone doesn't align with their own values. GOD.

"Okay wow, so, actually trying to watch this is just pure cancer.First of all, the guy just constantly talks shit about CG. As in, just name calls it constantly. Which is just whiney AF and not endearing to convincing anyone he's right.Second of all, the ""contrivances"" he constantly complains about is extremely weak nitpicky bullshit. Literally, it takes me almost zero effort to mentally dispel 90% of everything he says.I'll give a few examples.1. He complains Suzaku is given the Lancelot out of nowhere. Incorrect, he and all the other Elevens did simulations before hand and he had the best aptitude. 2. He complains its contrived for Kallen to be at Lelouch's highschool. Why? She's half Brittanian. Is it inconcievable that two Brittanians would attend the same school? Her being there is actually clever foreshadowing to her backstory that's revealed later.3. Zeros plan is stupid because it requires Lelouch to know Kallen would ask him to stay. Why? In the first place I'd say it doesn't, he just needed to time it well. Secondly, he didn't actually need to know she'd ask him to stay because he intentionally provoked her into doing so. The series *frequently* establishes the Lelouch is both good at reading and manipulating people. For this to not be an informed ability, he has to demonstrate he can *do it.*4. Saving Suzaku was stupid for multiple reasons which I'll address. First, why is it strange Jeremiah wants to set up a fall guy to explain why Clovis died? He can obviously manipulate the court so Suzaku being innocent clearly doesn't matter and he needs a scapegoat to show you can't assassinate royalty and get away with it. Two, why wouldn't he broadcast it on TV? Lee Harvey Oswald was on camera when he got shot during transfer. Three, why is it stupid for Jeremiah to think he can't handle some terrorists? He has a full escort, in the middle of a fairly well secured zone, and air support. I can't even go on.This just goes on and on. It really is a very terrible analysis.Basically, the reason he doesn't like Code Geass is that he has a very weak suspension of disbelief and a tendency to *want* to explain everything in the most negative light possible.

Two-minute passages in English and Japanese were read by the same female bilingual speaker. Twenty-four mother–fetus pairs (mean gestational age=35.5 weeks) participated. Fetal magnetocardiography was recorded while the participants were presented first with passage 1, a passage in English, and then, following an 18 min interval, with passage 2, either a different passage in English (English–English condition: N=12) or in Japanese (English–Japanese condition: N=12). The fetal magnetocardiogram was reconstructed following independent components analysis decomposition. The mean interbeat intervals were calculated for a 30 s baseline interval directly preceding each passage and for the first 30 s of each passage. We then subtracted the mean interbeat interval of the 30 s baseline interval from that of the first 30 s interval, yielding an interbeat interval change value for each passage. A significant interaction between condition and passage indicated that the English–Japanese condition elicited a more robust interbeat interval change for passage 2 (novelty phase) than for passage 1 (familiarity phase), reflecting a faster heart rate during passage 2, whereas the English–English condition did not. This effect indicates that fetuses are sensitive to the change in language from English to Japanese. These findings provide the first evidence for fetal language discrimination as assessed by fetal biomagnetometry and support the hypothesis that rhythm constitutes a prenatally available building block in language acquisition.",mvea,1500471848,t3_6o8j8a,t3_6o8j8a,24,0,dkfd8th,science,13,1.8461538461538465

I really don't. At the time I was devastated, sure, and even now, I do still feel some emotion come up when I review my memories of what happened, but looking back at it all now through an RP lens, it's like, Well OF COURSE she didn't care... I was just an expendable asset to her. I was her ticket to a green card. There was no emotional investment there. I was the solution to her problem, and as soon as I was taken ""off the table"" she was like, OK, we gotta find a new solution here. That's it. I totally get it.To be honest I actually included her as part of my 12 step amends process about 2 years back. Bumped into her totally randomly out here in LA (talk about a crazy coincidence, all these years later), and then I reached out and said ""Look, I get it now, I TOTALLY get it, and I want you to know I'm sorry that I wasn't stronger for you, back then, that I wasn't more of a man for you"", etc etc. I basically apologized (as best I could) for being a BP pushover, not knowing what was up, the whole deal. Of course she just kind of shrugged it off and didn't really care (the amends was more for me, to clean up the narrative on my end), but yeah, damn, remembering all that, it's like Wow, I CANNOT BELIEVE that I used to be so ignorant, so blind...So yeah, thank God for TRP.

"Fashion and style are part of a formalism and formalisms are always defined by and subject to change from the culture that produced them.  Montaigne said it best, though his comment was related to word definitions and the changing use of words over time:  ""Those who would combat usage with grammar make fools of themselves.""Fashion is always changing.  In my field, medicine, the necktie has vanished along with the physician's authority.  Nurses, adjusters and administrators now control everything that is done in the modern field of medicine; most physicians I know now wear short sleeves and no necktie, and the new formalism suits their reduced status.The entry of the legging into the working world is a peculiar thing, indeed.  I find I am with you: when I see a woman wearing leggings and nothing obscuring the buttocks and genital area, my first thought is that she forgot an article of clothing before she left the house.

"Hi. Just wanted to let you know you're not alone with this and what happened to you .. or what you suspect happened to you. I wouldn't normally outright share this, but I was raped by my father repeatedly as a child. It started as molestation and grooming aged 4. And then full on rape from the age of 6 to 10. Not only that but he was insanely violent. He beat the crap out of me most every day. He broke my nose by smashing me in the face with the bottom of a glass alcohol bottle. He forced me to watch him cut the ears and feet off of my pet ginea pigs. I've had no contact with him from the age of 11, upto now (I'm 27 now). Apart from one occasion 5 years ago when I wanted answers from him and he just laughed in my face and said I have a good memory. That was it. Enough. Adios. See ya later. ""Father"" is just a word given to a man who was one half of creating you. And that's very easy to do. Sadly that doesn't mean anything and doesn't instantly make that man a good man. I'm sorry this happened to you and you have to feel this way. I'm just letting you know I know how you feel. I'm so mentally damaged now I have no idea what to even do most days.

"The problem is with your premise: all else isn't held equal in the practical world of game design.As technology and particularly graphics get more advanced, you start to see longer and longer development times per piece of content (extremes: you might take years perfectly sculpting and animating one character in a modern 3d game, versus the ~weeks you might spend on a spritesheet for an 8- or 16-bit game.)Video game companies therefore have exponential growth on the time cost it takes for each piece of content that needs to be generated as the needed quality goes up.Video game companies *also* have deadlines and sales goals that they need to meet in order to stay afloat, which limits the time that they have to develop content for a given game.What can happen is one of two things: Make the *quality* of your content lower, or make *less* overall content.An open-world game is *always* going to require *more* overall content than a linear game, due to the tricks of the trade that you can use when it comes to making backgrounds look good (ie: I can pre-render a really detailed bitmap that isn't computationally expensive to use as a backdrop and only model 1 or 2 sides of a building if I know you can never get to it, versus having to model an entire interior and all 4 walls plus floorplans, etc; if you can interact with it, for instance).So by and large, unless you're dealing with exceptionally good studios, implementing an open world design is going to result in less overall quality in your assets than if you're sticking with a linear storyline, by most practical metrics.",Qwerty_Resident,1494014412,t3_69g7ch,t3_69g7ch,4,0,dh6hc2q,changemyview,94,0.0425531914893617

"To be fair, the Jews had been moving into the area for some time prior to World War Two. There had been small resettlement schemes under the Ottoman Empire, but the Turks really didn't care.

However, the period of initial Jewish settlement from 1880 to 1920 didn't feature removal of Palestinians but the settlement of Jews in unsettled or areas purchased for the purpose of Jewish settlement.It wasn't until the 1920's when a three corner conflict between Jewish Nationalist, Arab Nationalist, and the British started up that was really people being uprooted.

"Two things:  first off, a 4 year old has not even reached the ability to reason in a concrete manner.  That is why school doesn't usually start that early for them and when it does, it focuses on rote memory - not calculations.  So any 10 year old could outwit a 4 year old given enough time.  They are not on an equal footing.  But when you are talking age of consent matters, a 16 year old (usual age of consent) has a much better chance of holding his/her own with a 22 year old.But I will give you this much:  the internet has played a role in a change in some of these preteens' behaviors.  I worked with juvenile sexual predators for over a decade.  Near the end, we were finding kids for whom we could find no perpetrator.  The internet was usually the culprit in those cases.  I had one kid in my caseload who was barely pubescent and who taught a dog to lick his privates and rim him.  He was using bacon grease and peanut butter.  He also tried to pay a first grader to give him a blowjob.  Turns out he grew up with naïve grandparents who trusted him to properly use the internet.  I'm guessing that, instead, he found more and more provocative stuff and then tried to recreate it with whatever he had control over, AKA little kids who don't usually know better and animals.

"Also.Study 1Most victims of race crime—about 90 per cent—are white, according to the survey “Highlights from 20 Years of Surveying Crime Victims“, published in 1993.Almost 1 million white Americans were murdered, robbed, assaulted or raped by black Americans in 1992, compared with about 132,000 blacks who were murdered, robbed, assaulted or raped by whites, according to the same survey.Blacks thus committed 7.5 times more violent inter-racial crimes than whites even though the black population is only one-seventh the size of the white population. When these figures are adjusted on a per capita basis, they reveal an extraordinary disparity: blacks are committing more than 50 times the number of violent racial crimes of whites.Study 2In 1999, according to U.S. Dept. of Justice statistics, there were about 197,679 black-on-white violent crimes compared to about 8,198 white-on-black violent crimes (single-offender victimizations involving completed, as opposed to mere threatened, violence)– more than 20 times as many—and even more remarkably there were about 20,003 black-on-white rapes or sexual assaults (single-offender victimizations), while the number of white-on-black rapes or sexual assaults was somewhere between between 0 and 33. Black-on-white rapes or sexual assaults were at least 600 times as common as the reverse.http://ctwiki.us.to/index.php/Statistics/InterracialCrime",eaglezhigher,1428191390,t3_31gtq7,t3_31gtq7,14,0,cq1firl,CoonTown,20,0.7

"There's a big cultural schism within the SF/F genre at the moment, which is mentioned in the second paragraph of the article.

Which group is right? Possibly both and neither at the same time, I don't really know. What we do know is that it's a giant shitshow either way.

"It started with me following Satan while holding a bible in my hand. I didn't realize it was Satan at first. Then we were on top of a building looking down onto a city and he was saying how he was controlling the people in the city. Then, realizing that it was Satan I started attacking him but I wasn't hurting him. I was just annoying him if anything, then he threw me off the building and said ""do you not understand that I can kill you"" and I replied ""you can't kill me I will live forever with Jesus"". Then he departed from me and left me mangled in the street. The Angels came and picked me up and carried me to a hospital. Then an evil symbol started to Form on my hand and the Angels said ""that's demonic"" and I started to grow afraid but the Angels said lets sing praises to God so we did and the demonic symbol went away. Then the noise in the city started to get louder as if Satan was trying to drown out the sounds of our praises. And then God spoke and said ""don't stop praising Me"". So I didn't stop until I shot out of bed with my mind blown feeling like I didn't even sleep. It was crazy.",LoveAll316,1497068295,t3_6gd2oh,t3_6gd2oh,2,0,dipfo3c,Christianity,6,0.3333333333333333
"Putin would not trust an American politician blindly, he has been burned by them in the past (Putin has actually referenced House of Cards as a good description of how american politicians work).What is way more likely is that Trump did win this election with support from Russia, however this support is unlikely to be malicious to the American public, it is not a threat to Americans but is likely a threat to the Elite.The problem is of course that Americans have been subjected to massive anti-USSR/anti-Russia propaganda for so long that Russia is a symbol of all evil. So the result is that there is a Trump-Russia connection, but it will never come out in the right light, because American public is biased against Russia.The ridiculousness of the situation is that this conspiracy is very likely true, but it will never be seen in the right context, because again, Americans are conditioned to freak out whenever Russia is involved in anything. Hard to say what the end game is for this situation, but if history has showed us anything, it is that MSM is pretty good at reporting real events but always manipulating how they are perceived, so the gist of it is not that they are lying about Trump-Russia connecting, but that they are lying that it is unprecedented corruption.After all there is a lot of information of how other countries gained influence through Clinton's, but that has never caused such outrage and this massive scale of reporting.So to reiterate, Russia is involved, but not in the way it is being portrayed. The narrative is that Russia is the puppeteer, when in reality it's more of a 'pay for play' sort of deal (which is consistently happening everywhere in the world).",woop-woop,1495135432,t3_6bxvi3,t3_6bxvi3,2,0,dhqh6lo,conspiracy,8,0.25

When you say something like My question is: do you think that anti-Muslim sentiment and military bungling on the part of the West is responsible for Islamic extremism? Do you wish that Trump would condemn violence ""on many sides"" when there's a terror attack by an Islamic organization?My other question is, how many terror attacks by American right wingers would it take before you started to feel personally responsible for that violence? My guess is that it wouldn't matter how many because you'd still disagree with them in principle and feel that they didn't reflect your values no matter how many times it happened. And that's exactly how 99% of Muslims feel when there's terror perpetrated in the name of Islam.

"Thank you for keeping an open mind.  If the situation were reversed I would still be skeptical precisely because of the crimes of the untrustworthy CIA.  The same CIA that fabricated the Gulf of Tonkin to get involved in Vietnam, WMDs in Iraq, overthrowing elected leaders and manipulating foreign elections.  The burden of proof is on the CIA and we cannot simply take their word for it when they have no credibility.  I would hope logic would win out over partisanship.IMO all of this hysteria appears to have one of these motivations:1. Cast doubt in the minds of the electoral college before the 12/19 vote2. Delegitimize and sabotage the Trump government before he takes office so he fails and Dems win in 20203. Create diplomatic tensions with Russia for some crazy reason I can't understand; maybe just another way of making Trump look bad4. Passing the blame for Hillary's lossNow what kind of proof would be acceptable if the roles were reversed?  [This WikiLeaks email](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/34899) shows the likely point where John Podesta's gmail password was compromised when he clicked on the bit.ly phishing link (please don't click it).  As an independent voter the CIA would have to prove perhaps Russia was on the other end of that link.  Other possibilities include proving Russia supplied the emails to WikiLeaks, names of Russian government officials ordering the leaks, IP addresses of Russian hackers, or some other explanation of the content of the hacks.  Every voter should ask for more than taking the word of an unnamed CIA source.Spezdit: Also, to answer your question of ""would we sit on that information,"" a hypothetical Russian hack helping Hillary would be just another group stacking the odds [against us](https://i.sli.mg/rilOUt.jpg).

This would also explain why he's supportive of her relationship with the ""ronin"" (he doesn't know Chugo is part of Arson and Theft Control).  He can tell that Omatsu and Chugo's relationship goes beyond prostitute and client so supporting Chugo's expenses at the brothel is a way he can show some kindness to Omatsu without actually acknowledging her.This is all speculation based on some subtle lines of dialogue, but if it is true this means that Chugo is responsible for the death of his lover's father which would be very much in line with how this show often ends with tragedy.",chehalem,1486691931,t3_5sqr6l,t1_ddis9qt,5,0,ddk2lpc,anime,19,0.2631578947368421
